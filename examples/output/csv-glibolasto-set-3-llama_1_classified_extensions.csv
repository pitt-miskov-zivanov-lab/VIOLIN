(2009) reported that diverse proteasome inhibitors (including mg132) blocked vegfr2 expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and decreased vegfr2 protein levels were paralleled by impaired formation of capillary-like structures and endothelial cell migration (meissner et al., 2009). in sharp contrast, we observed that in vegfr2l cell population, the vegfr2 protein became stabilized and its levels increased already after a short-term exposure to the proteasome inhibitor mg132 (unpublished data). for endothelial cells under hypoxia, kremer et al. (1997) suggested a direct transcriptional induction of vegf that subsequently evoked up-regulation of vegfr2. in neural stem cells, expression of vegfr2 is up-regulated by bfgf-evoked signaling via phosphorylation of erk1/2 (xiao et al., 2007). we interpret these results as evidence for regulation of vegfr2 in gscs by rapid proteasome-mediated protein turnover, and indication that vegfr2 is subject to highly flexible and prompt control that are broadly analogous to key regulators of the cell cycle and cell viability/death pathways (e.g., cyclins, nf-κb inhibitors, etc.).",pmc3302235,1,0.1,39,1,39.1
