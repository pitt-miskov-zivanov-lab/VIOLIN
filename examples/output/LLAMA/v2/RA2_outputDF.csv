representative of,the cell cycle commitment at the restriction (r) point in g1 phase is initiated by inactivating phosphorylations of the central cell cycle/tumor suppressor prb by cdk4 and cdk6, which are activated by d-type cyclins induced by mitogenic/oncogenic signaling [1]–[3]. prb phosphorylation is then maintained independently of cyclins d, and hence of mitogens, by a positive feedback loop linking prb to e2f-dependent transcription of cyclin e, which leads to cdk2 activation and further phosphorylation of prb [4]. this, together with other positive-feedback circuits, such as e2f inducing its own transcription and the mutual inhibition between cyclin e-cdk2 and p27kip1, has been shown to generate a bistable prb-e2f switch to convert graded mitogen inputs into all-or-none e2f responses and thus cell cycle commitment [5]. the effects of the cip/kip cdk inhibitors p21 and p27 in this process are complex and remain much debated [6], [7]. p21 is the main transcriptional target involved in replicative senescence and p53-dependent cell cycle inhibition in response to dna damage. but in unperturbed cell cycles, it is also transiently induced by mitogenic stimuli during g1, before its required disappearance at the g1/s transition [8]. while p21 inhibits cdk2 [9], it also plays essential positive roles by stabilizing cyclin d-cdk4 complexes and allowing their nuclear import [3], [10]. how can p21 and p27 bind to cdk4 complexes and either inhibit or not inhibit their activity is poorly understood [3], [6], [8]. one debated possibility is related to different stoichiometries of the binding of these proteins to cyclin-cdk complexes [10], [11]. on the other hand, as first exemplified by t187 phosphorylation of p27 [12], phosphorylations of cip/kip proteins, including by oncogenic tyrosine kinases, have also emerged as other potential mechanisms for cdk regulation [13]–[17].,the rna profiling results suggest that smrt plays a significant role in gene repression after dna damage. however, smrt actually exhibited an activating action on some cddp-regulated genes, possibly due to secondary effects. the genes that we confirmed by rt-qpcr to be inhibited by smrt are all important regulators of apoptosis, belonging to different pathways. bcl2l11 (or bim) is a member of the “bh3-only” family of apoptosis facilitators; members of this family bind and inactivate pro-survival bcl2-like proteins, thus allowing permeabilization of mitochondrial membrane by bax/bak channels [64]. srpk2 is a protein serine-arginine kinase that, after dna damage, migrates to the nucleus and induces apoptosis through only partially defined mechanism [65]. max forms a functional dimer with myc and binds the promoter of target genes thus inducing cell proliferation as well as apoptosis [66], [67]. of particular interest, among the pro-apoptotic genes repressed by smrt there are some components or regulators of two major pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis: ap1 and nfκb. fos is a major transcription factor of the ap1 family [68], and has been associated with induction of apoptosis after different cellular stresses, including dna damage [31], [32]. smad7 is an inhibitory transcription factor activated by tgf-β signaling, required for repression of anti-apoptotic nfκb target genes [69]. the smrt complex is already known to be required for gene repression by ap1 [47] and nfκb [46]. in our experiments, smrt exerts a basal repressive function on nfκb genes, as its removal from the cells by sirna induces up-regulation of nfκb targets such as ppm1d (figure 2a) as well as il-8 and tnf-α (data not shown). in contrast, active recruitment of smrt on the promoter of ap1 targets such as c-fos occurs only after dna damage.,anova:

as an apoptosis promoter. like bcl-2, bcl-xl also prevents cytochrome c release from mitochondria [reviewed in [47]]. different studies showed that most likely every cell type is protected by at least one member of anti-apoptotic bcl-2-like proteins. in pancreatic carcinoma cells bcl-xl plays the most important role in protecting from fas and trail-mediated apoptosis [32]. furthermore, bcl-xl is believed to bind to apaf-1 and may therefore inhibit the association of apaf-1 with procaspase-9 and thereby prevent caspase-9 activation [48]. unlike bcl-2, bcl-xl is constitutively overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines highly resistant to fas and trail-mediated apoptosis [32]. therefore bcl-xl may be an ideal target for pancreatic cancer therapy. overexpression of bcl-xl in cell lines with low bcl-xl expression like colo357, showed complete suppression of apoptosis. on the other hand, inhibition of bcl-xl function by overexpression of bax or administration of antisense oligonucleotides against bcl-xl mrna resulted in sensitization of cells expressing high levels of bcl-xl like panc-1 or panctui [32]. additionally, another study revealed that bcl-xl antisense oligonucleotide inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth and caused apoptosis by reducing bcl-xl protein levels in different pancreatic cancer cell lines [49]. bcl-xl antisense nucleotides also increased the sensitivity to chemotherapeutics like gemcitabine. this was confirmed by another study [50]. activation of bcl-2 family member bcl-xl after repeated exposure to the chemotherapeutic drugs 5-fu and gemcitabine contribute to chemo-resistance of pancreatic cancer cells [50]. correlation of the molecular data with clinical patient parameters revealed that patients whose tumors exhibited no, faint, or weak bcl-xl expression lived significantly longer after tumor resection than patients whose tumors exhibited moderate bcl-xl mrna expression [51].,nox enzymes differ in both tissue distributions and mechanisms by which their activity is regulated (krause, 2004; lambeth et al., 2007). nox2 is expressed by phagocytic leukocytes, and its activity is triggered by inflammatory mediators which induce the assembly of four cytosolic regulatory proteins (p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and rac2-gtpase) with the nox2 core enzyme to stimulate superoxide formation. nox1 and nox3 are highly expressed in the colon epithelium and in the inner ear, respectively, and their activity is also regulated by rac1-gtpase and by related cytosolic adaptors, known as the activator subunit noxa1 (homologous to p67phox) and the organizer subunits noxo1 (homologous of p47phox) (banfi et al., 2003; geiszt et al., 2003; takeya et al., 2003). recently, we have shown that tyrosine kinase c-src substrate tks4 and tks5 proteins are novel members of the organizer superfamily (gianni et al., 2009), which directly bind the n-terminal proline-rich region (prr) of noxa1 (gianni et al.). finally, nox4 is widely distributed in the kidney, bone and vascular cells and its activity is independent of rac-gtpase.,of the novel gencode-annotated mecp2 transcripts, only one has an open reading frame annotated in the ucsc genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu), making it likely that the others may function as regulatory ncrnas. transcription of ncrnas from the mammalian genome is an increasingly recognized phenomenon (2,84), and ncrnas are being implicated in diverse cellular processes, including regulation of various levels of gene expression, regulation of localization and function of other molecules and in the targeting of generic enzymes to specific genomic loci (1). several recently discovered ncrnas that have not been well-characterized functionally, have been shown to have regulated expression patterns, suggesting that many ncrnas have important functions that are yet to be determined (85–88). mecp2 has been reported to interact with rna (44), and tissue-specific non-coding transcripts from mecp2 or other genes may be able to regulate mecp2 expression or function in a tissue-specific manner. in view of these insights, it seems possible that mutations disrupting the secondary structures of regulatory ncrnas from mecp2 may result in disturbed mecp2 expression and present clinically with a similar phenotype to those patients who have mecp2 coding-region mutations. as mecp2 is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, the novel transcribed region within intron 1 (figure 1) that has been detected in brain is of particular interest with regard to disease-causing capacity. further knowledge of the cellular localization, molecular interactions and qualitative or quantitative differences between rtt-patients and unaffected controls may provide additional insights into the biological functions and clinical relevance of these newly discovered ncrnas.,twist is an important inducer of emt, which downregulates the epithelial cell marker (e-cadherin) and upregulates mesenchymal markers (fibronectin, n-cadherin and vimentin), and promotes cancer invasion and metastasis.11, 12 twist expression promotes resistance to apoptosis when cells are challenged with cisplatin in lung and bladder cancer and paclitaxel in prostate cancer.13 accordingly, identification of the upstream activators and downstream targets of twist1 may be critical in determining new therapeutic targets for cancer. in the present study, we showed that knockdown of twist promotes or sensitizes lung cancer cells to apoptotic death via decreasing mtor/s6k1-dependent mcl-1 translation that allows cisplatin to exert its toxic effect. these results suggest that targeting molecular cross-talk between mtor and emt regulators may be an effective approach to combat cancer.,rt-qpcr analysis confirmed that bio suppressed htert expression in all three cell lines (figure 4b). in a2780, htert expression under bio treatment was reduced to 25% of control on day 28. expression in treated hct116 was 7% of control on day 28 and in 5637 was 24% of control on day 21. analysis of htert splice variants in a2780 cells revealed selective repression of the full length transcript (supporting figure s4). we observed that htert expression in bio treated 5637 returned to control levels on day 35. this observation is expanded below.,western blot (wb) analyses were performed with the nupage system (invitrogen) and densitometric evaluations were done with the imagequant 5.2 software (molecular dynamics). regγ phosphorylation analyses were performed using phos-tag (wako) at 30 μm in a 10% acrylamide gel (13). the antibodies used were: dbc1 (bethyl laboratories, a300–434a or cell signaling technology, clone 3g4); p53 (santa cruz, do-7); p53-ac-k382, phospho-chk2-t68, puma, cleaved parp-1 and cleaved caspase-3 (cell signaling technology); flag (clone m2), β-actin and sirt1 (sigma); ha (clone 12ca5, roche); regγ (transduction laboratories). chk2 antibody (clone 44d4/21) was previously described (33) or purchased from mbl intl corp (dcs-270 and dcs-273). immunoprecipitation (ip) experiments were carried out as described (12) using cell lysates prepared in elb buffer (150 mm nacl, 50 mm hepes ph 7.5, 5 mm edta, 0.5% np40). after preclearing with protein-g (for mouse antibodies) or protein-a (for rabbit antibodies) coupled sepharose beads (sigma), proteins of interest were subjected to ip with specific antibodies and analyzed by wb.,to investigate the mechanism involved in sirt1 inhibition by dbc1 and chk2, we initially determined whether chk2 depletion could affect dbc1 phosphorylation on thr454, but, as shown in supplementary figure s4, no significant differences were found between control and sichk2 transfected cells before and after etoposide exposure. we then analyzed dbc1-sirt1 association in response to dna damage in control and chk2 depleted u2os cells. although dbc1 and sirt1 protein levels were similar in all cell extracts (figure 2, right panel), we found that etoposide treatment increased the amount of sirt1 that co-immunoprecipitated with dbc1, as already reported (28,29), but no increase was seen in chk2-silenced cells (figure 2a left, compare lane 2 with lane 4). similar results were obtained analyzing the co-immunoprecipitation between dbc1 and sirt1 in flag-dbc1 overexpressing cells depleted of chk2 by sirna (supplementary figure s5), thus excluding an influence of dbc1 expression levels on chk2 regulation of dbc1-sirt1 complex formation. in addition co-immunoprecipitation (co-ip) assays performed in the presence of vrx indicated that the catalytic activity of chk2 is necessary for increasing dbc1-sirt1 binding in response to etoposide (figure 2b, left), even if vrx treatment alone seems to increase the association between these two proteins. however, since the dbc1-sirt1 association is regulated also by phosphorylative events, it is possible that this phenomenon could be an effect of chk2 inhibition on phosphatases activity as previously reported (38). to further verify the role of chk2 in promoting dbc1-sirt1 association, u2os cells were transfected with fixed amounts of vectors encoding dbc1 and flag-sirt1, and increasing amounts of a vector encoding ha-chk2, which is known to homodimerize and become active when overexpressed (39). flag-sirt1 immunocomplexes were then analyzed by western blot and, as expected, dbc1 binding to sirt1 increased with the expression of chk2 (figure 2c, left). similar experiments were performed to determine the role of thr454 phosphorylation in chk2-mediated increase of dbc1-sirt1 association and we found that chk2 overexpression cannot induce the binding of dbc1-t454a to sirt1 (figure 2d). altogether, these findings suggest that chk2 kinase promotes the physical association between dbc1 and sirt1 in dna damaged cells and, for this, the phosphorylation of dbc1 on thr454 by atm/atr is also required.,the major points that would need to be addressed are:,pten was shown to suppress breast cancer growth through down-regulating pi3k signaling, which leads to the blockage of cell cycle progression and the induction of cell death in a sequential manner [354]. in breast cancer cells under anchorage-independent conditions, pten also induced anoikis, a form of apoptosis that occurs when cells are dissociated from the extracellular matrix, which is enhanced in conjunction with low serum culture conditions [355]. together, these data suggest that pten effects on the pi3k signaling cascade are influenced by the cell stimulatory context, and that depending on the exposure to growth factors and other exogenous stimuli such as integrin ligation, pten can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or anoikis in breast cancer cells. the tumour suppressor activities of pten were linked to the machinery controlling cell cycle through the modulation of signaling molecules whose final target is the functional inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene product [356]. expression of wild-type pten reduced the expression of cyclin d1 [357]. cyclin d1 reduction was accompanied by a marked decrease in endogenous retinoblastoma (rb) protein phosphorylation on cyclin d/cdk4-specific sites, showing an early negative effect of pten on rb inactivation. pten expression also prevented cyclin d1 from localizing to the nucleus during the g(1)- to s-phase cell cycle transition [357]. the pten-induced localization defect and the cell growth arrest could be rescued by the expression of a nucleus-persistent mutant form of cyclin d1, indicating that an important effect of pten is at the level of nuclear availability of cyclin d1 [357]. furthermore, in human glioblastoma cells, pten mutation can cooperate with egfr activation to increase vegf mrna levels by transcriptionally up-regulating the proximal vegf promoter via the pi3k/akt pathway [358]. in addition, the ability of pten to potently inhibit h-ras-induced morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth in nih3t3 cells was reported [359]. it was also shown that pten can regulate prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis through inhibition of igf-ir synthesis [360].","pmc3084876,pmc3667761,pmc3656868,pmc2915986,pmc149420,pmc2993755,pmc2577328,pmc3388235,pmc2714081,pmc4245943,pmc4245943,pmc3771576,pmc2652403",13,0.1,39,1,40.3

cause of cancer related deaths in the united states and patients with advanced prostate cancer show poor prognosis with severe disease recurrence32. moreover, lack of bonafide molecular targets adaptable to specific therapeutic agents pose a major setback in the treatment of cap. therefore, new rational therapeutic approaches need to be established to curb cap. one of the major potential oncogenic pathway, pi3k-akt-mtor pathway, is up-regulated in 40–50% of prostate cancers, often through the loss of pten33. the other important signaling refers to the ras-mnk pathway. multiple inhibitors of these pathways including bevacizumab, gefitinib, docetaxel, rapamycin and everolimus etc. are either in clinical trials or are presently in the market. opting for the current conventional approaches is deeply corroborated with many negative distal consequences like hyperactivation of akt and increased translational rate of oncogenes33. regardless, various cancers, despite their genetic complexity, share a core group of perturbed signaling pathways which converge upon a few regulatory nodes that link these pathways with the basic metabolic machinery of a cell34. so it will be at par if we can target a key regulatory node, instead of targeting the genetic alterations individually. one such regulatory node is translation initiation complex eif4f, which turns multiple signalling pathways, converging upon it through eif4e, into a self amplifying signalling system and overwhelmingly redirects the translation apparatus of a cell towards the malignancy22. 3-azido withaferin a (3-awa), a potential derivative of α-β-unsaturated functionality of ring a of withaferin a, has been reported to exert anti-proliferative effect and proven superior over its well-known parent withaferin a with respect to stall cancer cell invasion. the presence of α-β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety in a plethora of natural products bestow them with an effective chemopreventive and chemoprotective properties, thus renders a high degree of specificity to overcome drug resistance14. although 3-awa exerts strong anti-proliferative activity in various cancer types, its anti-metastatic effects on aggressive and metastatic cap cells still needs clarification. in the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of 3-awa’s anti-tumor/anti-metastatic effects in the perspective of translational block as depicted in fig. 7. we, hereby, report for the first time that 3-awa attenuated eif4e induced tumorigenesis by abrogating its expression as well as activation. the eif4e is an important oncogene for cancer cell survival, growth, angiogenesis and events like epithelial to mesenchymal transition (emt) that lead to metastasis and is known to be over-expressed in cap635. moreover, eif4e is a rate limiting factor for the assembly of translation initiation complex, eif4f. currently, different inhibitors targeting eif4f are in clinical trials which block the activation of eif4e by mnk1 or prevent the association of eif4e with eif4g at initiation complex18. but no therapeutic agent has been yet reported that could consistently suppress both the expression as well as activation of eif4e. regulation of eif4e involves the two major pro-survival and pro-proliferative pathways, pi3k-akt-mtor and ras-mnk1 pathways, both of which are perturbed in cap. oncogenic ras mutation overrides the translation initiation control by constantly activating its downstream effector protein mnk1 to phosphorylate eif4e through ras-mnk1 pathway25. similarly, pi3k-akt-mtor pathway also controls the activation of eif4e oncogene by regulating the phosphorylation of key tumor suppressor protein 4ebp1. 4ebp1, when dephosphorylated interacts strongly with eif4e to impede its function but is unable to sequester eif4e when hyperphosphorylated in cancer36. herein, we found that 3-awa executed its negative regulatory effects on eif4e in pc-3/du145 cells, but not in normal prostate bph-1 cells by consistently blocking ras-mnk1and pi3k-akt-mtor pathways. since mtor inhibitor- induced eif4e phosphorylation is pi3k and mnk dependent, one strategy to improve an mtor inhibitor’s efficacy against cancer is to prevent eif4e phosphorylation by combining an mtor inhibitor with a pi3k inhibitor or a mnk inhibitor. in this study, we have demonstrated that 3-awa alone exerts similar kind of augmented growth-inhibitory effects in pc-3 cells by blocking akt-mtor pathway on one hand and simultaneously debilitates its (3-awa) mtor inhibitory effect on eif4e phosphorylation by impeding mnk-eif4e pathway. notably, the overall expression of eif4e was affected drastically as was confirmed by down-regulation of eif4e in c-myc transfected nih3t3 cells, suggesting that 3-awa mediated control of eif4e is exerted at transcriptional level (data not shown). this depicted the potential of 3-awa to inhibit eif4e mediated cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. the importance of this finding can be realized from the fact that over-expression of eif4e and its hyperactivation by oncogenic alteration in the above mentioned pathways is associated with poor prognosis and relapse-free rate, especially in cap patients37. furthermore, recently it has been shown that eif4e is not essential for global protein translation and eif4e knock down mouse developed normally38. importantly, no hyperactivation of key oncogenes including, akt and eif4e was observed in vitro with 3-awa treatment, as has been the case with mtor inhibitors like rapamycin, where the sudden hyperactivation of akt and eif4e in the background negate its anti-tumorigenic effects38. as 3-awa is a strong inducer of pro-apoptotic protein, prostate apoptosis response 4 (par-4), the plausible reason for the inhibition of akt might be due to stimulated par-4 mediated akt inhibition. earlier reports have demonstrated profound activation of akt due to par-4 ablation in par-4 ko as well as par-4/pkcζ dko cells suggesting par-4 as a strong selective negative regulator of akt15. thus, inhibition of eif4f complex formation assigns 3-awa a promising chemotherapeutic agent halting

(22) have reported that 14-3-3 enhances the transcriptional activity of p53 by increasing its half-life. further, 14-3-3 σ decreases the half-life of mdm2 and blocks mdm2-mediated p53 degradation by inhibiting mdm2’s ubiquitin ligase activity and also interferes with the nuclear-export activity of mdm2 towards p53 (22). our results, in general, are consistent with these observations and, further suggest that in addition to the previously identified σ isoform, τ might exert a similar regulatory mechanism towards p53. however, from our results, (i) it is possible that p53 might have additional σ and τ binding sites, which could directly interfere with mdm2-mediated degradation, (ii) these sites are created only upon dna damage. this hypothesis is supported by previous report that upon dna damage, 14-3-3σ stabilize p53 partly by direct binding and that this characteristic was not observed in p19arf (22). it must be noted that 14-3-3 proteins can also bind unphosphorylated targets and these targets bind to 14-3-3 proteins in the same location as phosphorylated targets (37). moreover, 14-3-3 σ has been shown to have different substrate specificity in comparison to other isoforms. hence, if p53 tad anchors additional binding sites for σ and τ that are created upon dna damage, it is possible that binding of σ and τ to p53 tad could competitively inhibit the binding of mdm2 to p53 tad, resulting in increased p53 levels, similar to competitive binding of p300 and mdm2 to p53 tad (29). while this is speculative at the moment, further experiments to identify σ and τ interaction sites on p53 would unravel the stabilization mechanism behind direct 14-3-3 and p53 interaction. perhaps there exist parallel pathways that could also lead to stabilization of p53 in the presence of 14-3-3. for instance, 14-3-3 τ stabilizes e2f-1 and e2f-1, in turn, stabilizes p53 by direct binding. further, e2f-1 upregulates p14arf, which negatively regulates mdm2 (38,39). in a different pathway, akt (protein kinase b) activation enhances p53 degradation. 14-3-3 σ binds and inhibits akt, resulting in p53 stabilization (40). hence, stabilization of p53 by 14-3-3 could be achieved through different pathways. perhaps, several other mechanisms of 14-3-3 mediated p53 stabilization remain unexplored.",pmc2817464,1,10,11,1,21
