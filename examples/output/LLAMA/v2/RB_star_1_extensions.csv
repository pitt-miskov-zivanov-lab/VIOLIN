(2012) recently described a similar inflammatory skin phenotype in a17δkc mice but proposed that it is caused by the loss of a putative ligand-independent notch activation by adam17, which, in turn, would normally suppress the production of thymic stromal lymphoprotein (tslp) in adult skin. however, another study has shown that tslp is produced as a consequence of skin barrier defects in general and does not depend on loss of notch signaling (demehri et al., 2008). importantly, we demonstrate that the invasion of inflammatory cells is a consequence of the skin barrier defects, and not the cause, because skin defects develop in a17δkc mice before inflammatory infiltrates and are not reversed by macrophage depletion with clodronate. moreover, our study identifies egfr-dependent regulation of tgms, which are directly responsible for establishing the skin barrier, as the most likely basis of the skin defect in a17δkc mice. this mechanism is further supported by the finding that egfrδkc mice develop chronic dermatitis and systemic myeloproliferative disease, just like a17δkc mice, and by rescue experiments of a17δkc mice with the egfr ligand and adam17 substrate tgf-α. therefore, we conclude that chronic dermatitis and systemic myeloproliferation in adam17 knockout mice are late manifestations of persistent egfr ligand deficiency and the resulting defective skin barrier. in this context, it should also be noted that previous studies have demonstrated both agonistic and antagonistic cross talk between the egfr and notch pathways (yoo et al., 2004; hasson et al., 2005; doroquez and rebay, 2006; aguirre et al., 2010), suggesting that the reduced notch signaling observed by murthy et al. (2012) in a17δkc skin could also be explained by lack of egfr activation. finally, both a17δkc and egfrδkc mice showed an outside-in barrier defect, which is thought to contribute to the pathogenetic mechanism of atopic dermatitis by exposing the skin to exogenous agents or antigens, which then trigger immune reactions (irvine and mclean, 2006; moniaga et al., 2010).","pmc3403298,pmc5241886,pmc6042963,pmc3371728",4,0.1,39,1,39.4
