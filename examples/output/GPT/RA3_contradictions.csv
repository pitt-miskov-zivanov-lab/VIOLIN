(b) representative images taken from crc organoids p18t-krasg12d treated for 72 hr with above described drug combinations. low amounts of navitoclax (65 nm) only induce cell death in combination with effective inhibition of the ras pathway using a high concentrations of afatinib and selumetinib. bar diagram at the right shows quantifications of cell death by scoring propidium-iodide stained nuclei (dead) over viable h2b-labeled nuclei (see materials and methods section) of minimal 15 organoids per condition (signals pooled prior ratioing, hence no standard deviation calculated: see materials and methods section). representative experiment of n = 2. (c) bar diagrams representing cellular viability (alamarblue assay)of organoids that have been recovered for six days after 72 hr drug treatment at different concentrations ranging from 5 µm (left) to 5 nm (right). color corresponds to targeted inhibitor as indicated in the legend. all values are normalized to control samples (dmso). targeting of the ras pathway does not provide long-lasting effects after drug removal, even combination treatments at high concentrations (green bars). however, it does sensitize for cell death induction using low amounts of navitoclax (black bars). an average of two independent experiments is shown. bar diagrams are averages of n = 2. (d) extensive dual or triple-inhibitor dose-response assay of patient-derived crc organoids p18t-krasg12d treated for 72 hr. 9×9 drug concentrations of selumetinib (meki) or afatinib/selumetinib (1/1) versus navitoclax (bcl2/bclxl) or venetoclax (bcl2) were chosen with logarithmic interval covering a 5 nm–20 µm range. the results of the full matrix screen are represented as heat maps, where red represents 0% atp levels (no viability) and green represents 100% atp levels (max viability). exploring optimal drug concentrations reveal that the more effective inhibition of the ras pathway is achieved (dual targeting and high concentrations), the less navitoclax is required. venotoclax, a bcl2-specific inhibitor, is not able to copy the effects of navitoclax (bcl2/bclxl).",pmc5127645,1,10,10,1,20
