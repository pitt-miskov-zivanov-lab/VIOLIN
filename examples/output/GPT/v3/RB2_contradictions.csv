139,foxp3,protein,,,fplx,foxp3,,,mtor,protein,,,fplx,mtor,,,positive,d,regulates,,,effector cell,,,['2'],nan,nan,"over the last few years, several studies have focused on the molecular mechanisms regulating the induction of foxp3, the master regulator of treg cells (josefowicz et al., 2012). consistent with the requirements for tgf-β1 and il-2 in the generation of itreg cells from naive mouse cd4+ t cells, activation of il-2–stat5 and tgf-β1–smad pathways are important for itreg cell differentiation. however, a growing body of data has revealed that other pathways contribute to the regulation of foxp3 expression, including those downstream of the tcr. notably, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (pi3k) and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) and akt pathways have been shown to play an instrumental role in regulating treg cell differentiation. mtor is part of an evolutionary conserved pathway involved in regulation of cell growth, translation, migration, and metabolism (powell et al., 2012). inhibition of pi3k/akt and mtor pathways, including targeted deletion of mtor, leads to foxp3 expression upon tcr stimulation of cd4 cells (battaglia et al., 2005; kopf et al., 2007; haxhinasto et al., 2008; kang et al., 2008; sauer et al., 2008; delgoffe et al., 2009; powell et al., 2012). moreover, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor α (hif1α), a downstream target of mtor pathways which contributes to the regulation of glucose metabolism, also helps regulate the balance between th17 and treg cell differentiation (dang et al., 2011; shi et al., 2011). in the absence of hif1α, cd4+ t cells fail to up-regulate glycolytic pathways important for effector cell differentiation and instead develop into foxp3+ treg cells. such data highlight the importance of mtor and downstream metabolic pathways in cell fate decisions. nonetheless, although much knowledge has been gained about these pathways, many questions remain regarding how the development and activity of treg cells and th17 cells are controlled to permit protective immunity without pathological self-reactivity.",pmc3949578,1,10,11,1,21

271,pi3k,protein,,,uniprot,,,,cd28,protein,,,fplx,cd28,plasma membrane,go:0005886,positive,d,activation,,,t-cell,,,['34'],nan,nan,"pi3k is activated by tcr and cd28 signaling and is involved in cell cycle progression, cell survival, proliferation, and regulation of cell trafficking, in part through the activation of pi(3,4,5)p3-binding pleckstrin homology (ph) domain–containing proteins. important downstream components of these processes in many cell types are the akt and mtor pathways, which play critical roles in regulating cellular metabolism and differentiation downstream of multiple receptors. notably, it is now well recognized that inhibition of mtor or akt in cd4+ t cells leads to expression of foxp3 (powell et al., 2012). this regulation is likely to occur via multiple mechanisms, including effects of akt on the foxo transcription factors (hedrick et al., 2012), which are required for foxp3 expression, as well as effects on distinct mtor-mediated pathways. thus, the mtor and akt axes play major roles as a gatekeeper of effector versus treg cell differentiation.",pmc3949578,1,10,11,1,21
