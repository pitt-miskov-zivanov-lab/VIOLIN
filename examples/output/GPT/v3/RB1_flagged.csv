(70) showed that inhibition of either mtor with ridaforolimus or akt with mk-2206 alone had no effect on the status of the other kinase in castrate-sensitive settings. however, simultaneous inhibition of both mtor and akt demonstrated additive antitumor effects (70). these findings strongly indicate that the mtor signaling network in the pten-null tumor is independent of akt activity and that both akt and mtor downstream signaling pathways play a part in pten-deficient prostate tumors. these results strongly support the rationale for using akt and mtor inhibitors in combination therapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01295632).",pmc3775430,1,10,19,1,29
