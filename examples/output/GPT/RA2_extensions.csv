p<0.05.,prostate cancer (cap), a burden to the healthcare system, remains to be the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the united states and patients with advanced prostate cancer show poor prognosis with severe disease recurrence32. moreover, lack of bonafide molecular targets adaptable to specific therapeutic agents pose a major setback in the treatment of cap. therefore, new rational therapeutic approaches need to be established to curb cap. one of the major potential oncogenic pathway, pi3k-akt-mtor pathway, is up-regulated in 40–50% of prostate cancers, often through the loss of pten33. the other important signaling refers to the ras-mnk pathway. multiple inhibitors of these pathways including bevacizumab, gefitinib, docetaxel, rapamycin and everolimus etc. are either in clinical trials or are presently in the market. opting for the current conventional approaches is deeply corroborated with many negative distal consequences like hyperactivation of akt and increased translational rate of oncogenes33. regardless, various cancers, despite their genetic complexity, share a core group of perturbed signaling pathways which converge upon a few regulatory nodes that link these pathways with the basic metabolic machinery of a cell34. so it will be at par if we can target a key regulatory node, instead of targeting the genetic alterations individually. one such regulatory node is translation initiation complex eif4f, which turns multiple signalling pathways, converging upon it through eif4e, into a self amplifying signalling system and overwhelmingly redirects the translation apparatus of a cell towards the malignancy22. 3-azido withaferin a (3-awa), a potential derivative of α-β-unsaturated functionality of ring a of withaferin a, has been reported to exert anti-proliferative effect and proven superior over its well-known parent withaferin a with respect to stall cancer cell invasion. the presence of α-β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety in a plethora of natural products bestow them with an effective chemopreventive and chemoprotective properties, thus renders a high degree of specificity to overcome drug resistance14. although 3-awa exerts strong anti-proliferative activity in various cancer types, its anti-metastatic effects on aggressive and metastatic cap cells still needs clarification. in the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of 3-awa’s anti-tumor/anti-metastatic effects in the perspective of translational block as depicted in fig. 7. we, hereby, report for the first time that 3-awa attenuated eif4e induced tumorigenesis by abrogating its expression as well as activation. the eif4e is an important oncogene for cancer cell survival, growth, angiogenesis and events like epithelial to mesenchymal transition (emt) that lead to metastasis and is known to be over-expressed in cap635. moreover, eif4e is a rate limiting factor for the assembly of translation initiation complex, eif4f. currently, different inhibitors targeting eif4f are in clinical trials which block the activation of eif4e by mnk1 or prevent the association of eif4e with eif4g at initiation complex18. but no therapeutic agent has been yet reported that could consistently suppress both the expression as well as activation of eif4e. regulation of eif4e involves the two major pro-survival and pro-proliferative pathways, pi3k-akt-mtor and ras-mnk1 pathways, both of which are perturbed in cap. oncogenic ras mutation overrides the translation initiation control by constantly activating its downstream effector protein mnk1 to phosphorylate eif4e through ras-mnk1 pathway25. similarly, pi3k-akt-mtor pathway also controls the activation of eif4e oncogene by regulating the phosphorylation of key tumor suppressor protein 4ebp1. 4ebp1, when dephosphorylated interacts strongly with eif4e to impede its function but is unable to sequester eif4e when hyperphosphorylated in cancer36. herein, we found that 3-awa executed its negative regulatory effects on eif4e in pc-3/du145 cells, but not in normal prostate bph-1 cells by consistently blocking ras-mnk1and pi3k-akt-mtor pathways. since mtor inhibitor- induced eif4e phosphorylation is pi3k and mnk dependent, one strategy to improve an mtor inhibitor’s efficacy against cancer is to prevent eif4e phosphorylation by combining an mtor inhibitor with a pi3k inhibitor or a mnk inhibitor. in this study, we have demonstrated that 3-awa alone exerts similar kind of augmented growth-inhibitory effects in pc-3 cells by blocking akt-mtor pathway on one hand and simultaneously debilitates its (3-awa) mtor inhibitory effect on eif4e phosphorylation by impeding mnk-eif4e pathway. notably, the overall expression of eif4e was affected drastically as was confirmed by down-regulation of eif4e in c-myc transfected nih3t3 cells, suggesting that 3-awa mediated control of eif4e is exerted at transcriptional level (data not shown). this depicted the potential of 3-awa to inhibit eif4e mediated cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. the importance of this finding can be realized from the fact that over-expression of eif4e and its hyperactivation by oncogenic alteration in the above mentioned pathways is associated with poor prognosis and relapse-free rate, especially in cap patients37. furthermore, recently it has been shown that eif4e is not essential for global protein translation and eif4e knock down mouse developed normally38. importantly, no hyperactivation of key oncogenes including, akt and eif4e was observed in vitro with 3-awa treatment, as has been the case with mtor inhibitors like rapamycin, where the sudden hyperactivation of akt and eif4e in the background negate its anti-tumorigenic effects38. as 3-awa is a strong inducer of pro-apoptotic protein, prostate apoptosis response 4 (par-4), the plausible reason for the inhibition of akt might be due to stimulated par-4 mediated akt inhibition. earlier reports have demonstrated profound activation of akt due to par-4 ablation in par-4 ko as well as par-4/pkcζ dko cells suggesting par-4 as a strong selective negative regulator of akt15. thus, inhibition of eif4f complex formation assigns 3-awa a promising chemotherapeutic agent halting eif4e dependent expression of many pro-metastatic and pro-proliferative proteins including c-flip, mmp-2, cyclin d1, c-myc and bcl2.,(avg. no of cells in control group – avg. no of cells in treated group)/(avg. no of cells in control group) × 100,all experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. all data collected from western blot and,quantitation of (b) represents mean % live cells relative to time ± sem for n = 3 independent experiments.,[editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.],all data processing was performed using the ideas v6.0 software (amnis). for each treatment and time point a total of 10000 cells were collected. following compensation, cells were gated as single (based on the area and aspect ratio of the bright filed mask) and in-focus (based on the gradient rms of the bright filed image). with the exception of 15 hours, at least 2000 cells were analyzed after gating. the nuclear, cytoplasmic and cellular masks of gated cells were calculated based on the following morphological and logical operations: cell, default mask for tfeb channel or 5-pixel erosion of default bright field mask; nucleus, 70 % threshold mask on hoechst channel; cytoplasm: cell and not nucleus. the features “intensity cell, nucleus and cytoplasm” were calculated as the total intensities (background subtracted) in their respective masks. the features “concentration cell, nucleus and cytoplasm” were calculated by dividing the intensity features by the area of their respective masks (in μm2). the feature “nuclear percentage” was calculated as the ratio between the features “intensity nucleus” and “intensity cell”, multiplied by 100. the feature “max contour position” was calculated with a build in function available in ideas software [16]. the feature “mean pixel nu/cyto” was calculated based on masks which underestimated the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in order to avoid including cytoplasmic pixels in the nuclear signal or including background or nuclear pixels in the cytoplasmic signal. underestimated masks were obtained by morphological erosion of the original masks. these feature values were exported to.fcs-files for further processing with the clustering software spade v2.0 (spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events) [15]. the number of clusters and combination of input features was optimized as presented on the results section. the remaining spade input parameters were set to default values (arcsinh with cofactor = 5, neighborhood size = 5, local density approximation factor = 1.5, max allowable cells in pooled down-sampled data = 50000, fixed number of cells remained = 20000, algorithm: k-means). clustering results were exported to.fcs files and subsequently converted to .txt files using the ideas software. text files were imported into matlab r2014a for data representation and further analysis.,criterion 1: the temporal evolution of the percentage of cells in each cluster should be consistent among repetitions, to assure the reproducibility of subpopulation dynamics.

[189] have studied further the structural impact of the l834r mutation of egfr; it may counteract the disordered structure of the inactive egfr kinase domain and facilitate the dimerization, so that the active kinase domain is stabilized. in addition, it has been suggested that y845 phosphorylation, by acting as a more physiological trigger of the conformational change seen in the l834r mutant, is part of the self-sustained egfr activation and amplification. a similar mechanism of stabilization of the active site by the amino acids near y845 has also been reported by timms et al.

(2005) arrived at a similar conclusion based on studies of progesterone-induced inhibition of sodium current in oocytes expressing enac subunits. the rapid reversibility of egf-induced inhibition of isc at early time points (<30 min; fig. 11) is also consistent with reversible alterations in channel gating rather than channel retrieval and degradation (booth and stockand, 2003). a recent study of wild-type and liddle's mutants expressed in mdck cells found poor channel recycling of internalized enac (chen et al., 2007). introduction of the β-s518k mutation (gating mutant with po ∼ 1.0) did not prevent the early inhibition by egf, indicating that the mechanism by which egf inhibits enac is independent of the normal gating process that is altered by the s518k modification. in fact, the s518k mutant was inhibited to a greater degree than wild-type enac. if egf-induced inhibition of enac function is due to protein modification of enac (e.g., subunit ubiquitination) resulting in channel inactivation, then an increase in fractional inhibition would be predicted with the β-s518k mutation. erk2 can phosphorylate c-terminal peptides from β- and γ-enac subunits (shi et al., 2002a), and progesterone-stimulated phosphorylation of β-enac is reduced by mutation of the putative erk phosphorylation site in β-enac (t613a) (michlig et al., 2005). it is unlikely that phosphorylation of enac per se is responsible for the erk-dependent reduction in enac activity since mutation of the adjacent py motif (y618a [michlig et al., 2005] and p616l [fig. 6]) blocked progesterone and egf-induced inhibition of sodium current. additionally, it is improbable that the interaction of nedd4-2 with enac alone results in a decrease with the po of enac, since expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of nedd4-2 (michlig et al., 2005) prevented the progesterone-induced decrease in enac activity, though presumably it should be capable of binding the channel. ubiquitination of the channel is a possible route by which open probability may be altered. the attachment of the first ubiquitin molecule involves the formation of a bond between ubiquitin's c-terminal glycine and a lysine residue on the target protein. additional ubiquitin molecules can then be attached to the first through attachment to one of three of its lysine residues: k29, k48, and k63 (arnason and ellison, 1994). a polyubiquitin chain consisting of four or more ubiquitin molecules attached through k48 is a characteristic signal targeting proteins for degradation in the 26s proteasome (thrower et al., 2000). recently a ubiquitin-specific protease, usp2-45, was identified among the early gene products expressed in response to aldosterone in the mouse distal nephron. this protein can deubiquitinate enac, resulting in an increase in sodium absorption (fakitsas et al., 2007). the identification of new classes of ubiquitin binding proteins and deubiquitinating enzymes thought to be involved in the processing and regulation of internalization (hicke and dunn, 2003; clague and urbe, 2006) add an additional level of complexity to the regulation of ubiquitination.",pmc2151644,1,1,40,1,41

(40) identified a mecp2-binding site near dlx5 and dlx6, and observed that transcript levels from each of these genes were elevated 2-fold in the frontal cortex of mecp2-null mice when compared to wild type. they went on to perform chromatin conformation capture (3c) assays and concluded that normal silencing of dlx5 and dlx6 was the result of a chromatin loop that was not detected in mecp2-null cells, suggesting that mecp2 mediated formation of this loop. while mecp2 may be able to form such structures, at least in vitro, schule et al. (41) have been unable to detect a reproducible or significant increase in expression of dlx5 and dlx6 in the frontal cortex of mecp2-null mice. as a result, the role of mecp2 in the silencing of these genes is now in doubt, although mecp2-binding sites within the dlx5/dlx6 locus have been confirmed by independent chromatin-immunoprecipitation (chip) assays (42).",pmc2577328,1,0.1,39,1,39.1
