of differences between data points means was calculated by the student’s t test.,data are presented as means of three independent experiments; statistical significance was evaluated by student's t test, where p<0,05 was considered statistically significant.,one of the challenges in using these gene expression signature scores is that many have been developed using fresh-frozen (ff) tissues on the affymetrix genechip (microarray) platform. in order for these signature scores to be clinically useful, they need to be adapted to the more commonly available archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissues [16, 17]. however, microarrays that can assess thousands of transcripts are not only expensive but also lack reproducibility, especially when evaluating ffpe samples having low rna quality [18, 19]. determinants of rna quality from ffpe samples have been reported to include storage time and conditions, fixation time and specimen size [20]. rt-qpcr and nanostring technologies have been reported to be useful for gene expression quantification in ffpe tissues [17, 21–23]. however, the recently developed, probe-based nanostring method was shown to be superior to the rt-qpcr approach in archived ffpe samples [22].,sfakianos et al. used the pca procedure to detect outliers and showed that the outliers were associated with poor quality samples [19]. more recently, guinney et al. performed quality control analysis for outlier detection using pca [11]. we adopted this procedure to identify samples that could possibly have “poor” rna quality. a scatterplot (see fig. 2) of the first and second principal component (pc1 and pc2) scores identified fifteen samples with low pc1 scores (hereby less than - 0.10) that were considered to be “outliers”, or samples likely to have “poor” rna quality. notably, as compared to other 39 “good” samples (see table 1b), most of 15 samples identified also had low standard deviations (signal-to-noise ratios) across probes (data not shown). furthermore, these 15 samples all had below average affy_ffpe mean scores in contrast to their wide-spread pattern for affy-ff scores (see fig. 3a). thus, these data support the notion that low pc1 scores were likely associated with “poor” rna quality, however, these 15 “bad” samples did not stand out among the nanos_ffpe mean scores (see fig. 3b), suggesting that nanostring technology may be more forgiving of poor rna quality inherent to these samples. the 15 samples identified with potential “poor” quality were removed, leaving 39 samples available for subsequent analyses.,statistical significance was determined using the unpaired student t-test on graphpad prism software (graphpad software inc.).,total cell extracts

mechanistic dynamic model, which was validated by experiments in mutant nras and brafv600e cancer cells [185]. this predictive model integrates structural elements of the braf-inhibitor interaction (i.e., dfg-in/dfg-out and αc-in/αc-out rules), with additional data, including thermodynamics and kinetics of drug-protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, and cell-line mutational status [185]. kinase inhibitors can be subdivided into three major groups according to the structure assumed by the dfg motif and the αc-helix of the kinase when bound to the inhibitor—(i) αc-in/dfg-in inhibitors (e.g., sb590885, gdc-0879), (ii) αc-in/dfg-out inhibitors (e.g., az-628 and tak-632), and (iii) αc-out/dfg-in inhibitors (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and encorafenib) [185]. according to this prediction model [185], the following combinations of braf inhibitors were identified and experimentally proved to be effective in inhibiting erk kinase activation in vitro according to a specific cancer cell mutational status [185]: (i) the association of αc-in/dfg-out and αc-out/dfg-in inhibitors was most effective in inhibiting the phosphorylation activity of raf homodimers or raf homo- and heterodimers in cancer cells bearing the brafv600e/wtbraf or brafv600e/nrasq61k mutations, respectively; (ii) combination of αc-in/dfg-in and αc-in/dfg-out inhibitors halted erk signaling from raf heterodimers in cancer cells harboring oncogenic ras mutations and wtras; (iii) finally, the αc-in/dfg-out and αc-out/dfg-in inhibitors pair was required to extend the inhibition of kinase activity of both raf homo- and heterodimers in cancer cells bearing both ras and raf activating mutations. altogether, these studies provide potent rules to establish the best combination of present and future braf inhibitors tin order to overcome paradoxical mapk pathway activation.,this study was approved by the hospital ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from
