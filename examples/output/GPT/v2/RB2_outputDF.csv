(2004). this repression is defective in itk-deficient cells, even under conditions in which wt and itk−/− cd4+ t cells develop equivalent percentages of foxp3+ itreg cells, suggesting that these observations are not secondary to altered differentiation. furthermore, treatment of itk-deficient cd4+ cells with pten-specific shrna reduced the generation of foxp3+ cells, supporting the idea that altered pten expression contributes to rather than results from the increased generation of foxp3+ cells. indeed, under conditions of strong tcr signals, where we see decreased expression of pten, we see reciprocal regulation and increased ps6 and elevated expression of the mtor target gene, hif1α. our results suggest that by altering the expression of pten, impaired tcr signaling can affect the activation of signaling pathways downstream of multiple receptors, supporting the idea that tcr signaling controls the ability of t cells to integrate diverse inputs. this regulation provides a distinct positive feedback mechanism by which pi3k-mediated pathways can be exquisitely controlled to affect effector cell differentiation.",pmc3949578,1,1,40,1,41
