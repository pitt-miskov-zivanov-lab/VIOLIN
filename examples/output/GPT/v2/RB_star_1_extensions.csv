bronchial tissue obtained from lung cancer patients undergoing resection surgery for lung cancer at lumc. this material was be used for research according to the “code of conduct for responsible use” (federa code) based on the condition that the patient has no objection against such use. primary bronchial epithelial cells (pbec) were isolated from tumor‐free lung resection material (wetering et al. 2000), and passage 2 expanded cells were cultured at the air–liquid interface (ali) to achieve mucociliary differentiation as previously described (amatngalim et al. 2015). briefly, 40,000 cells were seeded on 0.65 cm transwell inserts (corning costar, cambridge, ma) with a 0.4 μm pore size, which were coated with 30 μg/ml purecol (advanced biomatrix, san diego, ca), 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (sigma‐aldrich, st. louis, mo), and 10 μg/ml fibronectin (isolated from plasma). cells were cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium (begm) (lonza, verviers, belgium) and dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem) (gibco, bleiswijk, the netherlands) (1:1 mixture) containing 1 mmol/l hepes (lonza) and supplemented with singlequot supplements and growth factors according

15 ng/ml retinoic acid (sigma–aldrich), 1 mg/ml bsa (sigma–aldrich), 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (lonza). pbec were initially cultured on inserts in submerged conditions until cell layers were confluent. next, apical medium was removed and cells were cultured at air‐exposed conditions for at least 2 weeks to allow mucociliary differentiation. clinical history and lung function data were obtained from anonymized patients (table 1), and copd disease status was based on lung function data according to the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (gold) classification (vestbo et al. 2013). donor cells were randomly allocated to experimental groups.,to further elucidate whether increased alveolar macrophage efferocytosis plays a crucial role in promoting resolution of lps-induced lung inflammation by isoflurane, a recently developed in vivo model [26] was utilized. by transplanting bmdms treated with vehicle or isoflurane into alveolar macrophage-depleted mice, we specifically examined the effect of increased macrophage efferocytosis induced by isoflurane on resolution of lps-induced lung inflammatory injury. briefly, mice were first depleted of alveolar macrophages and then challenged with lps, followed by intratracheal delivery of bmdms pretreated with vehicle or isoflurane (fig 7a). as shown in our previous study [26], the spatial distribution of transplanted macrophages following intratracheal instillation in alveolar macrophage-depleted lungs receiving bmdms treated with vehicle or isoflurane is uniform and commensurate. consistent with our prior findings [26], pmn counts in bal fluid (fig 7b), lung mpo levels (fig 7c), protein levels in bal fluid (fig 7d), and edema formation (fig 7e) following lps challenge in control mice (without alveolar macrophage depletion) and alveolar macrophages-depleted mice were increased, reached peak levels at d 3 and then gradually declined. mice depleted of alveolar macrophages exhibited the postponed resolution of neutrophil infiltration (fig 7b and 7c), exuded protein (fig 7d), and lung edema (fig 7e) at d 7 and 9 following lps challenge whereas these delayed responses were reversed by administration of vehicle-treated bmdms (fig 7b–7e), indicating the important role of macrophages in resolution of lung inflammation. importantly, alveolar macrophage-depleted mice receiving isoflurane-treated bmdms showed further decreased pmn counts in bal fluid (fig 7b), lung mpo (fig 7c), protein level in bal fluid (fig 7d), and edema formation (fig 7e) compared with mice receiving vehicle-treated bmdms at d 5, 7 and 9 following lps challenge. lung tissues from control mice (without alveolar macrophage depletion) and alveolar macrophages-depleted mice had severe histological changes, including alveolar congestion, exudates, and infiltration of inflammatory cells at d 5 following lps challenge, in comparison with untreated mice (fig 7f). these histopathological alterations in lung tissues were ameliorated following administration of vehicle-treated bmdms and further dramatically improved by administration of isoflurane-treated bmdms, as seen in the significantly reduced lung injury score (fig 7f). consistently, at d 2 after injection of bmdms (d 5 following lps challenge), the number of macrophages containing apoptotic bodies or cells in bal fluid was much higher in isoflurane-treated lungs than in vehicle-treated lungs (fig 8a). to further demonstrate the role of isoflurane in the clearance of apoptotic pmns by macrophages in vivo, apoptotic mouse phrodo™ red (se)-labeled pmns were intratracheally injected into mice at d 2 following delivery of bmdms (d 5 following lps challenge) and bal fluid harvested 3 h later for determination of macrophage phagocytosis of pmns. as shown in fig 8b, the number of macrophages containing apoptotic pmns in bal was greater in mice receiving isoflurane-treated bmdms than in those receiving vehicle-treated bmdms. the levels of proinflammatory cytokines tnf-α (fig 8c) and il-6 (fig 8d) in the bal fluid were elevated and reached peak levels at d 1 (tnf-α) or 3 (il-6) following lps challenge and then gradually decreased thereafter in control mice (without alveolar macrophage depletion) and alveolar macrophages-depleted mice. at d 5, 7, and 9 following lps challenge, alveolar macrophage—depleted mice receiving vehicle-treated bmdms showed lower levels of tnf-α (fig 8c) and il-6 (fig 8d), which further decreased in alveolar macrophage—depleted mice receiving isoflurane-treated bmdms (fig 8c and 8d). alveolar macrophage—depleted mice receiving isoflurane-treated bmdms had a remarkably increased level of anti-inflammatory cytokines tgf-β1 (fig 8e) and il-10 (fig 8f) compared with those receiving vehicle-treated bmdms at days 5, 7, and 9 following lps challenge. collectively, these data strongly suggest that isoflurane promotes resolution of lung inflammation and injury during sepsis by enhancement of macrophage efferocytosis.,publisher's note: springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and

even though the oxidation has been shown, the exact regulatory mechanisms are still mostly elusive. it is however tempting to speculate that the oxidation by hydrogen peroxide is mediated via cytosolic prxs and the reduction via, for example, trx. trx proteins have been already shown to regulate myd88 and downstream map kinases. most tlrs need the adaptor protein myd88 for signal transduction, which functions downstream of the signal-receptor complex upon ligand binding. myd88 oligomerizes with the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (irak) forming a signal initiation complex. the complex signal transduction involves various proteins and kinases, eventually triggering map kinases and nfκb signaling pathways (figure 3) [41]. recently, stottmeier and dick demonstrated that myd88 undergoes redox regulation. in the presence of h2o2, myd88 dimerizes and forms disulfide-linked conjugates with other proteins via eight conserved cys residues (figure 4). interestingly, the oxidation by hydrogen peroxide is comparably sensitive to oxidation of prx2 [93]. s-nitrosylation of distinct cys residues of myd88 has also been described [94]. nucleoredoxin (nrx) controls tlr4 signaling by regulation of myd88, that is, by stabilizing the interaction of myd88 with flightless homolog 1 [21]. moreover, nrx was shown to regulate the adaptor protein, potentially as a disulfide reductase. nrx is related with trx, which additionally catalyzes de- and transnitrosylation of proteins. it is tempting to speculate that nrx has similar catalytic mechanisms and that it could regulate myd88 activity not only as disulfide reductase but also by regulating s-nitrosylation. interestingly, different regulatory functions for the eight cys residues have been introduced. mutation of c113 inhibited nfκb signaling, whereas mutating the other cys residues individually and especially simultaneously enhanced nfκb activity. note that these seven cys residues are all located in the tir domain [93]. different kinases, including the map kinases, are responsible for signal transduction and have been described to be susceptible to redox regulation. trx1 and also grx1 regulate ask1 and downstream kinases such as erk, jnk, and p38. the reduced oxidoreductases bind to ask1 and thereby inhibit the enzymatic activity of the kinase. in case of trx1, the protein interaction initiates ubiquitin-mediated degradation. oxidation of the oxidoreductases induces the dissociation of the complex and restores kinase activity [1, 14, 95, 96]. interestingly, ask1 is involved in tlr4 signaling and has however not been shown to be essential for other tlr pathways (figure 3) [97, 98].",pmc5651112,1,0.1,39,1,39.1

various proinflammatory mediators to promote leukocyte recruitment and activation of the surrounding tissue. in this process, the il-6r and the membrane-bound precursor of tnfα are proteolytically cleaved by adam17; this shedding process leads to the generation of proinflammatory acting tnfα and sil-6r (figure 5()). shedding of il-6r from apoptotic neutrophils generates an agonist of il-6 signaling, allowing the activation of cells, which do not express the membrane-bound il-6r, but the ubiquitously expressed signaling subunits of the il-6 receptor complex gp130. this transsignaling mechanism promotes the attraction of monocytic cells and inflammation [46, 105, 106]. moreover, adam17 cleaves members of the egfr ligand family, which are essential for their function as growth factor and tissue regeneration [107–109]. various ligands of the tlr and noxs induce the activity of adam17 that is essential for immune response/inflammation and regeneration (figure 4()) [47, 83, 110, 111]. in the healthy airway, tlr signaling can be upstream of exogenous atp [112, 113]. duox1 is recruited to atp-activated purinergic p2yr, followed by association with src, which becomes oxidized. src in turn oxidizes and activates adam17, which amplifies egfr activation and promotes immune defence and regeneration, involving an erk1/2-dependent production of the neutrophil attractant il-8 (figure 4()) [114, 115]. dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to inflammatory diseases, for example, cystic fibrosis and chronic inflammatory airway disease [116–120]. lps-induced activation of adam17 in macrophages was shown to rely on the activity of pkcδ and p38. this activation is tlr4- and nox2-dependent and targets the tyrosine kinase mer, which inhibits inflammatory signaling during efferocytosis [121]. in primary monocytes, lps-induced activation of adam17 is also mediated by ros and p38 [122]. in hepatocytes, src activates nox1, which in turn activates adam17 that releases tgfα for the stimulation of the egfr [123]. this process is caveolin-1-dependent. adam17, nox1, and nox2 are located and active within lipid rafts [75, 123–126]. the interaction of nox1 and adam17 was shown by coimmunoprecipitation [127]. interestingly, adam17 can also be activated by mitochondrial ros in a src- and pkc-independent way via the activation of the p2y receptor by atp in fibroblast [128] and fas-mediated apoptosis in neutrophils [129]. the activation of adam17 by members of the nox family appears to be dependent on the activity of kinases such as src, pkc, p38, and/or erk1/2. these kinases have been previously shown to be involved in the regulation of adam17, which is multilayered and only partially understood [130–133]. interestingly, the extracellular part of adam17 is a target for regulatory events. in its mature form, the n-terminal catalytic domain is followed by a disintegrin domain, a membrane-proximal domain (mpd), and a conserved helical stalk region called conserved adam seventeen interaction sequence (candis), a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail [134–137]. the mpd exists in two conformations that control the activity of the protease [135, 138]. a linear order of two disulfide bridges (c600–c630 and c635–c640) leads to an open, flexible structure, which is able to interact with the plasma membrane and substrates [139, 140]. reduced protein disulfide isomerase (pdi), a member of the trx protein family, catalyzes the isomerisation to an overlaying pattern (c600–c635 and c630–c640) causing a close, compact structure, which abrogates membrane binding and substrate recognition and thereby adam17 activity. in line, pdia1 and pdia6 were found to act as negative regulators [22, 135, 141] (figure 5()). the thiol switch as a general posttranslational mechanism to regulate the activity of members of the adam family appears to be unlikely since adam17 and its closest relative adam10 are atypical members of the protein family. the other members lack the redox-regulated mpd domain and contain a cysteine-rich and an egf-like domain instead [134, 136]. therefore, no comparable posttranslational thiol switch can be expected and indeed so far no posttranslational regulation of these proteases via nox, ros in general or specific oxidoreductases has been described to our knowledge. it is however possible that the activity of adam10, which contains a mpd homolog to the one of adam17, is regulated via a comparable thiol switch. the isolated open form of the adam17-mpd can be expressed as a soluble protein and the closed from can be obtained by refolding or by enzymatic catalysis by pdis, converting the open form to the close form. so far, no open adam10-mpd was obtained by expression in e. coli (unpublished observations), indicating that no open form exists and/or that the interaction with the n-terminal located disintegrin domain might be tighter and more important for the stabilization than in adam17. this might point against a regulatory thiol switch of adam10 and fit to the observation that the activity of adam17 is more strongly regulated than the activity of adam10, which can be constitutively active. however, a thiol switch in adam10 cannot be excluded since reports indicate that the shedding activity of adam10 can indeed be stimulated by ros [142, 143]. pdis attack the ckvc motive in the mpd of adam17, which is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, but not present in animals such as pike, hamadryad, or drosophila. adam10 on the other hand contains the chvc motif that is also conserved in evolutionary higher animals. this indicates that during evolution with increased complexity and potential higher risks of uncontrolled substrate release, a regulatory mechanism of the protease became essential. note that the posttranslational regulation of proteins by a thiol switch in their ectodomains is not unique for metalloproteases. for example, cd30 contains no ckvc or chvc motive and is targeted by trx1 which results in an altered ligand binding [144], whereas adam17 becomes inactivated by the thiol switch, and β1 and β3 integrins become activated [145]. intriguingly, this can be catalyzed by identical pdis, such as pdia1 and pdia6. since β1 and β3 integrins contain numerous cxxc motives, but not a ckvc motive, pdis may recognize different cxxc motives.",pmc5651112,1,0.1,39,1,39.1

(2012) recently described a similar inflammatory skin phenotype in a17δkc mice but proposed that it is caused by the loss of a putative ligand-independent notch activation by adam17, which, in turn, would normally suppress the production of thymic stromal lymphoprotein (tslp) in adult skin. however, another study has shown that tslp is produced as a consequence of skin barrier defects in general and does not depend on loss of notch signaling (demehri et al., 2008). importantly, we demonstrate that the invasion of inflammatory cells is a consequence of the skin barrier defects, and not the cause, because skin defects develop in a17δkc mice before inflammatory infiltrates and are not reversed by macrophage depletion with clodronate. moreover, our study identifies egfr-dependent regulation of tgms, which are directly responsible for establishing the skin barrier, as the most likely basis of the skin defect in a17δkc mice. this mechanism is further supported by the finding that egfrδkc mice develop chronic dermatitis and systemic myeloproliferative disease, just like a17δkc mice, and by rescue experiments of a17δkc mice with the egfr ligand and adam17 substrate tgf-α. therefore, we conclude that chronic dermatitis and systemic myeloproliferation in adam17 knockout mice are late manifestations of persistent egfr ligand deficiency and the resulting defective skin barrier. in this context, it should also be noted that previous studies have demonstrated both agonistic and antagonistic cross talk between the egfr and notch pathways (yoo et al., 2004; hasson et al., 2005; doroquez and rebay, 2006; aguirre et al., 2010), suggesting that the reduced notch signaling observed by murthy et al. (2012) in a17δkc skin could also be explained by lack of egfr activation. finally, both a17δkc and egfrδkc mice showed an outside-in barrier defect, which is thought to contribute to the pathogenetic mechanism of atopic dermatitis by exposing the skin to exogenous agents or antigens, which then trigger immune reactions (irvine and mclean, 2006; moniaga et al., 2010).",pmc3371728,1,0.1,39,1,39.1
