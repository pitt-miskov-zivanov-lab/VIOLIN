(a) one of the most prominent pip3 effectors is the protein kinase akt. upon pi3k activation, akt translocates from the cytosol to the membrane, where it binds pip3 and is phosphorylated and activated by pdk1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) and the rapamycin-insensitive complex containing mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin), mtorc2. akt is considered as a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation, as well as survival, by phosphorylating and regulating the activity of several proteins, which convey growth-factor-derived signals to cellular functions. for example, akt phosphorylates and inactivates tsc2 (tuberous sclerosis complex 2), which, in a complex with tsc1, is responsible for inhibition of rheb (ras homolog enriched in brain). thus, release of this inhibition results in activation of mtorc1 complex, which is important for promoting protein translation and accelerating cell growth in neurons. its deregulation is associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders (costa-mattioli and monteggia, 2013). akt also phosphorylates and inactivates gsk3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), a serine/threonine kinase that has been associated with a number of neuronal responses, particularly during neuronal development by regulating microtubule dynamics (hur and zhou, 2010). besides akt, pip3 also provide a signal for membrane recruitment and activation of a number of small gtpase regulators, particularly gefs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and gaps (gtpase activating proteins) of the rho and arf families of gtpases (krugmann et al., 2002; welch et al., 2002). in this manner pi3k, can regulate the activation state of rho and arf family gtpases, thereby influencing cytoskeletal and vesicular trafficking events at the membrane crucial for almost all aspects of neuronal polarity including migration, neurite outgrowth as well as axon and dendrite specifications. pten inhibits the signaling output of pi3ks by dephosphorylating pip3 back to pip2 (pi(4,5)p2). the numerous modes of activation of pi3k by upstream signals and growth factors are not depicted. (b) pten is formed of 403 amino acids and its structure displays an n-terminal pip2 binding motif (pbm), a phosphatase domain, a calcium-independent lipid-binding c2 domain, and a flexible c-terminal tail (cter-tail) followed by a pdz-binding motif (pdz) (lee et al., 1999; shi et al., 2012; song et al., 2012). the phosphatase and c2 domains form a minimal structural unit that is capable of dephosphorylating pip3 (lee et al., 1999). interestingly, highly unstructured elements such as the pbm, parts of the c2 domain and the c-terminal tail have important implications for the regulation of pten (lee et al., 1999; malaney et al., 2013). the phosphatase domain bears the p-loop signature motif of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphatases (123hcxxgxxr130) with cys124 being the active site residue. mutation of cys124 to ser renders pten inactive and this form of pten has been important to determine whether pten functions depend on its phosphatase activity (myers et al., 1998). interestingly, pten can also function as a protein phosphatase and putative protein substrates have been proposed in seminal studies (e.g., tamura et al., 1998). the pten protein phosphatase activity can be equally important for autoregulation of pten and some pten functions pertinent to its tumor suppressive role, at least under certain settings (tibarewal et al., 2012; bassi et al., 2013). the positions of pten posttranslational modifications (ubiquitination and phosphorylation) as well as catalytic and membrane binding features (p-loop and cbr3-loop) that are discussed in the text are indicated.",pmc3978343,1,10,10,1,20
