(22) have reported that 14-3-3 enhances the transcriptional activity of p53 by increasing its half-life. further, 14-3-3 σ decreases the half-life of mdm2 and blocks mdm2-mediated p53 degradation by inhibiting mdm2’s ubiquitin ligase activity and also interferes with the nuclear-export activity of mdm2 towards p53 (22). our results, in general, are consistent with these observations and, further suggest that in addition to the previously identified σ isoform, τ might exert a similar regulatory mechanism towards p53. however, from our results, (i) it is possible that p53 might have additional σ and τ binding sites, which could directly interfere with mdm2-mediated degradation, (ii) these sites are created only upon dna damage. this hypothesis is supported by previous report that upon dna damage, 14-3-3σ stabilize p53 partly by direct binding and that this characteristic was not observed in p19arf (22). it must be noted that 14-3-3 proteins can also bind unphosphorylated targets and these targets bind to 14-3-3 proteins in the same location as phosphorylated targets (37). moreover, 14-3-3 σ has been shown to have different substrate specificity in comparison to other isoforms. hence, if p53 tad anchors additional binding sites for σ and τ that are created upon dna damage, it is possible that binding of σ and τ to p53 tad could competitively inhibit the binding of mdm2 to p53 tad, resulting in increased p53 levels, similar to competitive binding of p300 and mdm2 to p53 tad (29). while this is speculative at the moment, further experiments to identify σ and τ interaction sites on p53 would unravel the stabilization mechanism behind direct 14-3-3 and p53 interaction. perhaps there exist parallel pathways that could also lead to stabilization of p53 in the presence of 14-3-3. for instance, 14-3-3 τ stabilizes e2f-1 and e2f-1, in turn, stabilizes p53 by direct binding. further, e2f-1 upregulates p14arf, which negatively regulates mdm2 (38,39). in a different pathway, akt (protein kinase b) activation enhances p53 degradation. 14-3-3 σ binds and inhibits akt, resulting in p53 stabilization (40). hence, stabilization of p53 by 14-3-3 could be achieved through different pathways. perhaps, several other mechanisms of 14-3-3 mediated p53 stabilization remain unexplored.",pmc2817464,1,10,11,1,21
