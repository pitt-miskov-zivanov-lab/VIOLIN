[25] demonstrated that there could be a switch between cytoprotective and cytotoxic autophagy in breast tumor cells treated with radiation either alone or in combination with vitamin d (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin d3; 1,25-d3) or a vitamin d analog. while a number of studies, including our own, have demonstrated that radiation alone induces cytoprotective autophagy [24,25,26,27,28], treatment of zr-75-1 or mcf-7 breast tumor cells with 1,25-d3 and irradiation promoted autophagic cell death as a mode of radiation sensitization [24,25]. evidence for sensitization was based on a decrease in clonogenicity and a reduction in cell viability compared to radiation alone. the conclusion that autophagic cell death was the mode of sensitization was based on the increase in acridine orange staining, the formation of punctate rfp-lc3, as well as an increase in autophagic vesicle formation quantified by facs (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis. minimal apoptosis was detected with the combination treatment as measured by the tunel (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end-labeling) assay and dapi (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, annexin/pi staining, western blots analysis for both parp cleavage and caspase-3 cleavage, and facs analysis for a sub-g1 population. most critically, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of 1,25-d3-radiation-induced autophagy (by bafilomycin a1 or chloroquine, and knockdown of atg5 or atg7) resulted in reduced radiation sensitivity where cell viability was restored to levels similar that observed with irradiation alone. on the other hand, inhibition of irradiation-induced cytoprotective autophagy resulted in a decrease in cell viability [24,25]. these findings indicate that breast tumor cells can be sensitized to radiation through the promotion of autophagic cell death.","pmc4891035,pmc4100138",2,0.1,39,1,39.2

[60] on human breast cancer cell lines mda-mb-468 and mcf-7. treatment of tumor cells with the mimic of mir-30a decreased the expression of beclin-1 mrna and protein, whereas administration of the mir-30a antagomir increased beclin-1 levels. furthermore, high expression of mir-30a blunted the activation of autophagy induced by rapamycin [60]. mir-376b also regulates beclin-1, and it can also directly target atg4c [29, 61, 62] in mcf-7 cells, because the antagomir-mediated inactivation of the endogenous mir-376b results in an increased level of atg4c and beclin-1 [26, 61]. the direct regulation of uvrag is modulated by mir-374a and mir-630 [63]. the tumor suppressive mir-101 could act as a potent inhibitor of basal, etoposide-induced, and rapamycin-induced autophagy in mcf-7 cells. frankel et al. [64] used 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-oht) to induce cell death in breast-cancer-derived mcf-7 cells (a stimulus to which they are usually resistant), synergistically with mir-101 as an autophagy inhibitor. the mir-101-mediated inhibition of autophagy sensitized breast cancer cells to 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced apoptotic cell death, and thus mir-101 was suggested to modulate the chemosensitivity of cancer cells [29]. three components, including stmn1 (stathmin1), rab5a (ras-related protein 5a), and atg4d, have been identified as targets of mir-101, among which the overexpression of stmn1 could partially rescue cells from mir-101-mediated inhibition of autophagy, indicating a functional importance for this target. rab5a and stmn1 had previously uncertain roles in autophagy. rab5a has been shown to regulate atg5–atg12 conjugation in the autophagosome completion, while stmn1 destabilizes microtubules and plays an important role in cell-cycle regulation [65]. most likely, at least in breast cancer cells, elevated levels of autophagy, due to the progressive loss of mir-101, have the potential to trigger cancer cell survival [29, 64]. mir-221/222 might inhibit the cell-cycle inhibitor, p27kip1, a downstream modulator of pi3kci/akt, leading to autophagic cell death in her2/neu-positive primary human breast carcinoma mcf-7 cells, whereas the ectopic expression of mir-221/222 renders the parental mcf-7 cells resistant to tamoxifen [66, 67].",pmc4182068,1,0.1,39,1,39.1
