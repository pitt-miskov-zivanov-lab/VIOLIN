gene expression. recently, this signaling pathway has been implicated in the induction and progression of hematological malignancies [209]. in fact, nuclear nfat2 was found in cases of burkitt’s lymphoma, diffuse large b cell lymphoma and aggressive t-cell lymphoma [210,211]. surprisingly, in fibroblasts, distinct and opposing roles for the transcription factors nfat1 and nfat2 in tumorigenesis were revealed in which nfat1 functions as a tumor suppressor and nfat2 as an oncogene [212]. in t-all, cn was reported to contribute to leukemogenesis in icn1 and etv6-jak2 mouse models of t-all, in which sustained activation of the pathway by microenvironmental cues leads to constitutive desphosphorylation of nfat. inhibition of cn by csa and fk506 could induce significant anti-leukemic effects leading to rapid disease remission and improved survival. on the other hand, ectopic expression of a constitutively active cn mutant accelerated leukemia progression and invasiveness [213]. the molecular mechanisms that account for sustained activation of cn in leukemic cells remain to be identified, but may require signaling from the in vivo tumor microenvironment and have been shown to be independent of tcr and pre-tcr expression (the main cn activators in normal t progenitors), at least in the etv6-jak2 mouse model [213]. recent developments have further strengthened the role of cn activation in the pathogenesis of t-all. indeed, elegant work demonstrated that conditional deletion of cnb1 in leukemic cells impairs leukemia propagation, reduced survival and homing upsetting adhesive interactions between leukemic cells and their supportive stroma [214]. in addition, cn activation was found to be critical for leukemia initiating/propagating cell activity as cn-deficient leukemic cells were unable to transplant the disease to syngeneic recipient mice [214]. a limitation of the therapeutic pre-clinical findings is that currently available cn inhibitors appear suboptimal as therapeutic agents, since they are associated with serious side effects [215], show off-target effects in t-all cells [214], and potentially interfere with the anti-tumor immune response. thus, it is not surprising that alternative options have been explored to dampen cn signaling. in fact, several groups have tried to identify and target molecular pathways acting downstream of cn and critical in t-all biology. stemming from this consideration, recent work identified a series of cn-dependent genes in t-all including cell cycle inhibitors (notoriously difficult to target therapeutically), and genes implicated in adhesion/migration [214]. the authors followed-up on these findings and found that cn regulates the adhesive/migratory properties of t-all cells by increasing c-x-c motif chemokine receptor 4 (cxcr4) surface expression in a cortactin-dependent way [216]. the ligand for this chemokine receptor, c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 12 (cxcl12) or stromal-derived growth factor-1 (sdf-1) is of particular importance as it is secreted by numerous cell types in the bone marrow such as osteoblasts lining the bone endosteum and endothelial cells [217] and is implicated in the homing of hematopoietic stem cells to the bone marrow [218]. recent studies have demonstrated that the critical source of cxcl12 is the endothelial compartment of the vascular niche [219]. inactivation of cxcl12 in the vascular niche or cxcr4 in t-all cells impairs their lic activity in both murine t-all and human xenografts [216,219]. of note, another cxcl12 binding receptor has been identified and called c-x-c motif chemokine 7 (cxcr7) [220,221], whose relevance to t-all biology is still ill-defined. in fact, t-all cells express cxcr7 and it may potentiate cxcr4 responses to cxcl12 [222]. recently, we undertook a more proteomic approach to identify putative downstream targets/effectors contributing to the pro-oncogenic activity of cn in t-all. indeed, we used tandem affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry to identify cn-interacting proteins in t-all cells. we found that the isolated proteins were implicated in numerous key signaling pathways, including eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eif2) signaling, cell cycle control, mtor signaling and 14-3-3 mediated signaling [223]. systematic inhibition of the top signaling pathways enriched in our cna protein complex identified a highly synergistic drug interaction between inhibition of cn and the pi3k/akt/mtor signaling pathway. further studies showed that akt represented the critical node of the pathway to inhibit to obtain the most synergistic cytotoxic effect with cn inhibitors. this cytotoxic effect was prevalently due to the strong reduction in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid leukemia 1 (mcl-1). our studies also uncovered a complex interaction between gsk-3β and cn/nfat signaling in t-all cells [224]. in fact, in resting cells glycogen synthase kinase 3 (gsk-3) participates in maintaining nfat proteins in their inactive hyper-phosphorylated form, antagonizing cn/nfat signaling [225,226]. gsk3 is a constitutively active kinase that is phosphorylated and inactived by pi3k and akt signaling [227]. surprisingly, we found that cna was able to directly interact with gsk-3β and increase its kinase activity possibly by augmenting its autophosphorylation. these results reiterate the complex role of gsk-3 in cancer, as this kinase has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in certain tumors, whereas in others it acts a tumor promoter [228]. we found that gsk-3β acts mainly as a tumor promoter in t-all by promoting the stabilization of proteins such as mcl-1, c-myb, and possibly x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (xiap). interestingly, dual cn and gsk-3β inhibition showed a synergistic anti-leukemic effect in vitro and in vivo, via downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as xiap and claspin [224]. in conclusion, all these studies highlight how the cn/nfat pathway links microenvironmental derived signals with the intrinsically altered signaling pathways found in t-all and provide additional targets and perspectives for future therapeutic strategies.,recent discoveries regarding the genetic basis of t-all have provided new insight in the development of this malignancy and we now have a good overview of the various pathways that are altered in t-all.3, 29 however, many of the in vitro model systems used to study developmental and oncogenic t-cell signaling pathways ex vivo can be limiting due to either not being physiological or require the use of feeder-cell lines. here we analyzed the pro-t-cell culture system as a new cellular model and show using a systems biology approach that pro-t cells recapitulate thymic t cell at the dn2–dn3 stage. we also identified distinct transcriptional networks in the pro-t cells downstream of il7, scf and dll4. significantly, the pro-t-cell transcriptome clusters reconciled with the in vivo dn2–dn3 t-cell stages and revealed somewhat surprisingly that there was limited cross talk between the il7r and pi3k/akt signaling with no akt phosphorylation observed in response to il7 stimulation and vice versa no stat5 phosphorylation in response to scf stimulation.,domains composed of zinc-fingers. the first four zinc-fingers represent

(2004). this repression is defective in itk-deficient cells, even under conditions in which wt and itk−/− cd4+ t cells develop equivalent percentages of foxp3+ itreg cells, suggesting that these observations are not secondary to altered differentiation. furthermore, treatment of itk-deficient cd4+ cells with pten-specific shrna reduced the generation of foxp3+ cells, supporting the idea that altered pten expression contributes to rather than results from the increased generation of foxp3+ cells. indeed, under conditions of strong tcr signals, where we see decreased expression of pten, we see reciprocal regulation and increased ps6 and elevated expression of the mtor target gene, hif1α. our results suggest that by altering the expression of pten, impaired tcr signaling can affect the activation of signaling pathways downstream of multiple receptors, supporting the idea that tcr signaling controls the ability of t cells to integrate diverse inputs. this regulation provides a distinct positive feedback mechanism by which pi3k-mediated pathways can be exquisitely controlled to affect effector cell differentiation.",pmc3949578,1,1,40,1,41

against cancer is dependent on the formation of long-lived memory t cells with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into potent effector cells. these goals have been approached by various means, including using defined central memory t cells as a starting population for gene modification, optimizing car design, and supplementing with cytokine cocktails during ex vivo expansion [8, 18, 26, 27]. all of these strategies are feasible, but validation before translating to a clinical platform is costly and time-consuming. there are several pharmacologic candidates capable of driving t cells toward the memory phenotype, such as those activating the wnt/β-catenin pathway [14] and inhibiting m-tor mediated protein translation [28]. however, the concentration required for significant inhibition of t cell differentiation might also lead to immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative activity [29, 30]. our data support that addition of akti at 1 μm during ex vivo expansion did not interfere with cd8 + cd19 car t cell proliferation and expansion. the same results were also observed in different t cell subsets such as bulk t cell, tcm, and naïve/memory-derived cd19car t cells, indicating that this is a general feature of the akti on t cell proliferation and expansion and therefore can be used for clinical manufacturing of therapeutic doses of car t cell products without the restriction of starting t cell populations. our data indicated that akti at 1 μm resulted in modest reduction (12%) of phosphorylated akt in the car t cells. a ~5-fold increase in concentration is anticipated to further reduce phosphorylated akti at ser 473 [31]. however, careful titration of akti during car t cell generation is necessary to maximize potency without suppressing t cell expansion and function. the optimal concentration of akti may additionally vary among the various t cell subsets as starting population. efficient car t cell therapy relies on potent effector function and in vivo persistence following adoptive transfer. our studies demonstrated that manipulation of levels of akt activation enhanced the antigen-specific effector function of cd19car t cells as indicated by elevated th1 cytokines such as ifnγ and gm-csf while preventing differentiation. studies have shown that t cells with memory characteristics positively correlate with in vivo persistence and antitumor activity post adoptive transfer [32]. despite no statistically significant differences as a result of variation among donors and a limited number of donors, our studies consistently demonstrated that akti-treated cd19car t cells exhibited higher expression levels of cd62l and cd28 without expression of exhaustion phenotypes such as klrg1, which are the traits required for efficient anti-tumor activity following adoptive transfer [33]. in further support, there did not appear to be a difference in telomere length between cultures with or without akti. upon transfer into cd19 tumor-bearing mice, akti-treated cd8 + cd19car t cells efficiently inhibited tumor growth and induced long-term survival as a result of improved antitumor activity and/or expansion. the role of the akt signaling pathway in cd4+ cells is more complicated and poorly understood than in cd8+ cells because of the interplay of regulatory versus conventional cd4+ t cells that contain different cd4+ t cell subsets. however, more tumor reduction in the mice treated with an akti-inhibited mixture of cd4 + cd19car and cd8 + cd19 car t cells indicates the minor impact of akti-treated tregs on the overall therapeutic effects. this validates the use of akti when both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells are included in the starting population for car t cell engineering and manufacturing. we also found that akti-treated car t cells did not induce alloreactivity, an important safety consideration. built on the pre-clinical studies [8–10, 34] demonstrating that tcm and naive/ memory t cells possess characteristics that correlate with improved anti-tumor activity, current clinical trials have developed a clinical platform for purification, transduction, and expansion of cd19car tcm for adoptive immunotherapy, with the goal of long-term car t cell disease surveillance [35]. our current studies demonstrate that akti does not inhibit tcm and naïve/memory-derived cd19car t cell expansion but promotes the generation of memory cd19car t cells with greater antitumor activity and supports the use of akti for further improved car t cell therapy in these advanced platforms. the underlying mechanisms may be related to changes in metabolic and transcriptional signatures characteristic of long-lived memory t cells that are reprogrammed by akt inhibition [16, 25, 36]. meanwhile, our data support that akt inhibition has no impact on replicative senescence based on the lack of changes in relative telomere length and exhaustive features.",pmc5359873,1,1,40,1,41

[234], a constitutively active form of β-catenin was used that was expressed from the dn3 stage onwards and determined the accumulation of dp thymocytes which were predisposed to malignant transformation. the resulting leukemias were associated with c-myc upregulation but did not develop notch1 mutations. these findings, together with the report that human t-all cases without notch1 mutations show high wnt signaling levels [235], suggest that aberrant wnt signaling may be a leukemia initiating event similar to notch signaling. on the other hand, two recent studies show an important tumor suppressor role for t-cell factor 1 (tcf1) in t-all development [236,237]. in both studies, mice deficient for tcf1 are highly susceptible to develop phenotypically heterogeneous leukemias (due to several incomplete successive t-cell developmental blocks). in fact, it was found that upon tcf1 deletion, lef1 protein levels become deregulated in all thymic subsets, resulting in abnormally high levels of the long isoform of lef1, thus predisposing thymocytes to leukemic transformation. interestingly, a key role for lef1 has been found in mouse models of leukemias induced by activated forms of notch [238]. in fact in these lymphomas, notch1 was found to directly transcriptionally regulate lef1 expression. hence, deregulation of lef1 expression, either via lack of the tumor suppressor tcf1 or aberrant activation of notch pathway accelerates lymphomagenesis. these findings in the mouse appear relevant for human t-all. in fact deletions and mutations in lef1 that inactivate its expression has been found in t-all [239], and more recently loss of tcf1 has been reported in a subset of pediatric t-all, the etp subgroup, in which two patients were found to have deletions of transcription factor 7 (tcf7) [the gene encoding tcf1] [237]. additionally, gene expression profiling of tcf7−/− lymphomas showed upregulated expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2c (mef2c) [236], which has been recently associated with an immature t-all subgroup [26]. in conclusion, these results indicate that tcf1 may act as a tumor suppressor in certain subgroups of pediatric t-all (etp-all and mef2c positive t-all). recently, a further twist to the role of wnt signaling has been added. in fact, active wnt signaling has been shown to be restricted to minor subpopulations within bulk tumors, and these wnt-active subsets were highly enriched for leukemia initiating activity (i.e., putative t-all stem cells) [240]. in these stem cells, hypoxia-inducible factor α (hif-1α) was also activated. genetic inactivation of β-catenin or hif-1α severely reduced stem cell frequency, while having minimal impact on the growth or viability of bulk tumor cells, implying that elements of wnt and hif pathways specifically support leukemic stem cells.",pmc5618553,1,0.1,39,1,39.1
