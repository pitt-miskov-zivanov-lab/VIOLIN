xref ).,it has been shown that phosphorylation of β-catenin at critical target residues (such as at ser 45 , ser 33/37 and thr 41 ) by gsk-3β and ck1α within the cytosolic destruction complex leads to degradation of β-catenin and thus reduces its nuclear accumulation ( xref ).","pmc4102778,pmc3847898,pmc4201705,pmc3465275,pmc3960186,pmc4923074,pmc317355,pmc2920641,pmc4472173,pmc3166074,pmc3145779,pmc4662463,pmc3110128,pmc4202122,pmc4596494,pmc4963809,pmc4515820,pmc3784440,pmc3926861,pmc4086981,pmc4351937,pmc4267697,pmc3682694,pmc2193656,pmc4725457",25,0.1,39,1,41.5
