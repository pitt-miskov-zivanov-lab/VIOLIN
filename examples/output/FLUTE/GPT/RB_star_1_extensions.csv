various proinflammatory mediators to promote leukocyte recruitment and activation of the surrounding tissue. in this process, the il-6r and the membrane-bound precursor of tnfα are proteolytically cleaved by adam17; this shedding process leads to the generation of proinflammatory acting tnfα and sil-6r (figure 5()). shedding of il-6r from apoptotic neutrophils generates an agonist of il-6 signaling, allowing the activation of cells, which do not express the membrane-bound il-6r, but the ubiquitously expressed signaling subunits of the il-6 receptor complex gp130. this transsignaling mechanism promotes the attraction of monocytic cells and inflammation [46, 105, 106]. moreover, adam17 cleaves members of the egfr ligand family, which are essential for their function as growth factor and tissue regeneration [107–109]. various ligands of the tlr and noxs induce the activity of adam17 that is essential for immune response/inflammation and regeneration (figure 4()) [47, 83, 110, 111]. in the healthy airway, tlr signaling can be upstream of exogenous atp [112, 113]. duox1 is recruited to atp-activated purinergic p2yr, followed by association with src, which becomes oxidized. src in turn oxidizes and activates adam17, which amplifies egfr activation and promotes immune defence and regeneration, involving an erk1/2-dependent production of the neutrophil attractant il-8 (figure 4()) [114, 115]. dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to inflammatory diseases, for example, cystic fibrosis and chronic inflammatory airway disease [116–120]. lps-induced activation of adam17 in macrophages was shown to rely on the activity of pkcδ and p38. this activation is tlr4- and nox2-dependent and targets the tyrosine kinase mer, which inhibits inflammatory signaling during efferocytosis [121]. in primary monocytes, lps-induced activation of adam17 is also mediated by ros and p38 [122]. in hepatocytes, src activates nox1, which in turn activates adam17 that releases tgfα for the stimulation of the egfr [123]. this process is caveolin-1-dependent. adam17, nox1, and nox2 are located and active within lipid rafts [75, 123–126]. the interaction of nox1 and adam17 was shown by coimmunoprecipitation [127]. interestingly, adam17 can also be activated by mitochondrial ros in a src- and pkc-independent way via the activation of the p2y receptor by atp in fibroblast [128] and fas-mediated apoptosis in neutrophils [129]. the activation of adam17 by members of the nox family appears to be dependent on the activity of kinases such as src, pkc, p38, and/or erk1/2. these kinases have been previously shown to be involved in the regulation of adam17, which is multilayered and only partially understood [130–133]. interestingly, the extracellular part of adam17 is a target for regulatory events. in its mature form, the n-terminal catalytic domain is followed by a disintegrin domain, a membrane-proximal domain (mpd), and a conserved helical stalk region called conserved adam seventeen interaction sequence (candis), a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail [134–137]. the mpd exists in two conformations that control the activity of the protease [135, 138]. a linear order of two disulfide bridges (c600–c630 and c635–c640) leads to an open, flexible structure, which is able to interact with the plasma membrane and substrates [139, 140]. reduced protein disulfide isomerase (pdi), a member of the trx protein family, catalyzes the isomerisation to an overlaying pattern (c600–c635 and c630–c640) causing a close, compact structure, which abrogates membrane binding and substrate recognition and thereby adam17 activity. in line, pdia1 and pdia6 were found to act as negative regulators [22, 135, 141] (figure 5()). the thiol switch as a general posttranslational mechanism to regulate the activity of members of the adam family appears to be unlikely since adam17 and its closest relative adam10 are atypical members of the protein family. the other members lack the redox-regulated mpd domain and contain a cysteine-rich and an egf-like domain instead [134, 136]. therefore, no comparable posttranslational thiol switch can be expected and indeed so far no posttranslational regulation of these proteases via nox, ros in general or specific oxidoreductases has been described to our knowledge. it is however possible that the activity of adam10, which contains a mpd homolog to the one of adam17, is regulated via a comparable thiol switch. the isolated open form of the adam17-mpd can be expressed as a soluble protein and the closed from can be obtained by refolding or by enzymatic catalysis by pdis, converting the open form to the close form. so far, no open adam10-mpd was obtained by expression in e. coli (unpublished observations), indicating that no open form exists and/or that the interaction with the n-terminal located disintegrin domain might be tighter and more important for the stabilization than in adam17. this might point against a regulatory thiol switch of adam10 and fit to the observation that the activity of adam17 is more strongly regulated than the activity of adam10, which can be constitutively active. however, a thiol switch in adam10 cannot be excluded since reports indicate that the shedding activity of adam10 can indeed be stimulated by ros [142, 143]. pdis attack the ckvc motive in the mpd of adam17, which is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, but not present in animals such as pike, hamadryad, or drosophila. adam10 on the other hand contains the chvc motif that is also conserved in evolutionary higher animals. this indicates that during evolution with increased complexity and potential higher risks of uncontrolled substrate release, a regulatory mechanism of the protease became essential. note that the posttranslational regulation of proteins by a thiol switch in their ectodomains is not unique for metalloproteases. for example, cd30 contains no ckvc or chvc motive and is targeted by trx1 which results in an altered ligand binding [144], whereas adam17 becomes inactivated by the thiol switch, and β1 and β3 integrins become activated [145]. intriguingly, this can be catalyzed by identical pdis, such as pdia1 and pdia6. since β1 and β3 integrins contain numerous cxxc motives, but not a ckvc motive, pdis may recognize different cxxc motives.",pmc5651112,1,0.1,39,1,39.1
