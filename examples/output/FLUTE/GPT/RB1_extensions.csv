(48) reported for the first time the combined role of pten loss and myc gain using global high-resolution cgh analyses validated by fish in a cohort of 126 intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after receiving radiotherapy. they reported that copy number alterations in pten (allelic loss) and myc (allelic gain) were associated with significantly increased genetic instability and biochemical relapse compared to tumors with normal pten and myc status. in light of these results, triaging patients by the use of pten and myc copy number changes within pre-treatment biopsies may allow for better use of systemic therapies to target sub-clinical metastases or locally recurrent disease and improve clinical outcomes (48).",pmc3775430,1,100,40,1,140

(41) determined that ar expression was significantly lower in prostate cancer tumors harboring a pten deletion compared to those with no pten deletion. however, the underlying mechanism associating decreased ar expression in the presence of pten deletion is still unclear (41). el sheikh et al. (42) also showed in 47 samples of hormone naive prostate cancers that reduced expression of either biomarker was associated with the development of androgen independence and reduced survival in patients whose tumors remained androgen dependent (42). in contrast, sircar et al. (26) reported a positive correlation between pten deletion status and up-regulation of ar expression in crpc patients. these results suggest that ar expression levels differ according to the stage of the disease, with genomic amplification of ar likely to occur in crpc, but rarely in untreated prostate cancer (43, 44). therefore, ar gene amplification may play a direct role in prostate cancer progression and may be associated with failure of androgen deprivation therapy (adt). since ar expression levels are low in hormone naive tumors, addition of an inhibitor of pi3k/mtor to the standard adt of advanced prostate cancer may therefore be beneficial to patients with pten deleted tumor. a number of other studies have implicated differential expression of ar and pten deletions/akt activation as significant predictors for disease progression and the development of crpc (37, 44, 45). their data suggest that assessment of pten/ar co-expression proves useful in distinguishing prostate cancer with a more favorable prognosis from those with a high likelihood of developing recurrent disease.",pmc3775430,1,100,40,1,140
