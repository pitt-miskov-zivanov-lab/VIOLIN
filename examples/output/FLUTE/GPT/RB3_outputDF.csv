against cancer is dependent on the formation of long-lived memory t cells with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into potent effector cells. these goals have been approached by various means, including using defined central memory t cells as a starting population for gene modification, optimizing car design, and supplementing with cytokine cocktails during ex vivo expansion [8, 18, 26, 27]. all of these strategies are feasible, but validation before translating to a clinical platform is costly and time-consuming. there are several pharmacologic candidates capable of driving t cells toward the memory phenotype, such as those activating the wnt/β-catenin pathway [14] and inhibiting m-tor mediated protein translation [28]. however, the concentration required for significant inhibition of t cell differentiation might also lead to immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative activity [29, 30]. our data support that addition of akti at 1 μm during ex vivo expansion did not interfere with cd8 + cd19 car t cell proliferation and expansion. the same results were also observed in different t cell subsets such as bulk t cell, tcm, and naïve/memory-derived cd19car t cells, indicating that this is a general feature of the akti on t cell proliferation and expansion and therefore can be used for clinical manufacturing of therapeutic doses of car t cell products without the restriction of starting t cell populations. our data indicated that akti at 1 μm resulted in modest reduction (12%) of phosphorylated akt in the car t cells. a ~5-fold increase in concentration is anticipated to further reduce phosphorylated akti at ser 473 [31]. however, careful titration of akti during car t cell generation is necessary to maximize potency without suppressing t cell expansion and function. the optimal concentration of akti may additionally vary among the various t cell subsets as starting population. efficient car t cell therapy relies on potent effector function and in vivo persistence following adoptive transfer. our studies demonstrated that manipulation of levels of akt activation enhanced the antigen-specific effector function of cd19car t cells as indicated by elevated th1 cytokines such as ifnγ and gm-csf while preventing differentiation. studies have shown that t cells with memory characteristics positively correlate with in vivo persistence and antitumor activity post adoptive transfer [32]. despite no statistically significant differences as a result of variation among donors and a limited number of donors, our studies consistently demonstrated that akti-treated cd19car t cells exhibited higher expression levels of cd62l and cd28 without expression of exhaustion phenotypes such as klrg1, which are the traits required for efficient anti-tumor activity following adoptive transfer [33]. in further support, there did not appear to be a difference in telomere length between cultures with or without akti. upon transfer into cd19 tumor-bearing mice, akti-treated cd8 + cd19car t cells efficiently inhibited tumor growth and induced long-term survival as a result of improved antitumor activity and/or expansion. the role of the akt signaling pathway in cd4+ cells is more complicated and poorly understood than in cd8+ cells because of the interplay of regulatory versus conventional cd4+ t cells that contain different cd4+ t cell subsets. however, more tumor reduction in the mice treated with an akti-inhibited mixture of cd4 + cd19car and cd8 + cd19 car t cells indicates the minor impact of akti-treated tregs on the overall therapeutic effects. this validates the use of akti when both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells are included in the starting population for car t cell engineering and manufacturing. we also found that akti-treated car t cells did not induce alloreactivity, an important safety consideration. built on the pre-clinical studies [8–10, 34] demonstrating that tcm and naive/ memory t cells possess characteristics that correlate with improved anti-tumor activity, current clinical trials have developed a clinical platform for purification, transduction, and expansion of cd19car tcm for adoptive immunotherapy, with the goal of long-term car t cell disease surveillance [35]. our current studies demonstrate that akti does not inhibit tcm and naïve/memory-derived cd19car t cell expansion but promotes the generation of memory cd19car t cells with greater antitumor activity and supports the use of akti for further improved car t cell therapy in these advanced platforms. the underlying mechanisms may be related to changes in metabolic and transcriptional signatures characteristic of long-lived memory t cells that are reprogrammed by akt inhibition [16, 25, 36]. meanwhile, our data support that akt inhibition has no impact on replicative senescence based on the lack of changes in relative telomere length and exhaustive features.",pmc5359873,1,1,40,1,41

(2004). this repression is defective in itk-deficient cells, even under conditions in which wt and itk−/− cd4+ t cells develop equivalent percentages of foxp3+ itreg cells, suggesting that these observations are not secondary to altered differentiation. furthermore, treatment of itk-deficient cd4+ cells with pten-specific shrna reduced the generation of foxp3+ cells, supporting the idea that altered pten expression contributes to rather than results from the increased generation of foxp3+ cells. indeed, under conditions of strong tcr signals, where we see decreased expression of pten, we see reciprocal regulation and increased ps6 and elevated expression of the mtor target gene, hif1α. our results suggest that by altering the expression of pten, impaired tcr signaling can affect the activation of signaling pathways downstream of multiple receptors, supporting the idea that tcr signaling controls the ability of t cells to integrate diverse inputs. this regulation provides a distinct positive feedback mechanism by which pi3k-mediated pathways can be exquisitely controlled to affect effector cell differentiation.",pmc3949578,1,1,40,1,41
