figure 5c, lane 2 compared to lane 7, and figure 5d). however, this result was unexpected because this assay is performed in conditions that should prevent the detection of biotinylated (internalized) proteins at the beginning of the glutathione-chase. a possible explanation to this observation is that the experimental condition was not sufficiently efficient to avoid the internalization of egfr at the beginning of the glutathione-chase. if this was the case, the difference in the levels of detected biotinylated egfr at time = 0 could correspond to differences in internalization kinetics. thus, this result suggests that egfr is internalized faster in shgolph3 cells. interestingly, at 2.5 min of glutathione-chase, the levels of biotinylated egfr in shgolph3 cells were significantly lower, compared to control cells, at both high serum (figure 5a, lane 3 compared to lane 8, and figure 5b) and low serum concentration (figure 5c, lane 3 compared to lane 8, and figure 5d). considering that at time = 0 of glutathione-chase we detected a significant amount of biotinylated egfr in shgolph3 cells under both serum concentration conditions, this result indicates that egfr recycling was intrinsically faster in shgolph3 cells than in control cells. the time course of glutathione-chase after 2.5 min showed varied levels of biotinylated egfr detected depending on the serum concentration used. under high serum, we observed in control cells a significant decrease in the levels of biotinylated egfr from 2.5 to 5 min of glutathione-chase that was followed by a significant increase at 7.5 min (figure 5a, lanes 3–5 and figure 5b). this fluctuating detection is indicative of a ~5 min time of recycling to the cell surface. in contrast, under the same high serum condition, we observed at 5 min in shgolph3 cells slightly, but significant higher levels of biotinylated egfr that was followed by a significant decrease at 7.5 min (figure 5a, lanes 8–10 and figure 5b). in this case, the fluctuating detection suggests a recycling time largely below 5 min, more likely closer to 2.5 min. on the other hand, under low serum, we observed in control cells a steady increase in the levels of biotinylated egfr from 2.5 to 7.5 min of glutathione-chase (figure 5c, lanes 3–5 and figure 5d). because we did not detect a fluctuating decrease in the levels of biotinylated egfr during the entire period of glutathione-chase, this result suggests that the recycling time in control cells under low serum is >5 min. likewise, the levels of biotinylated egfr detected in shgolph3 cells from 2.5 to 7.5 min (figure 5c, lanes 8–10 and figure 5d) indicate a slowdown in the recycling time compared to high serum treatment that nevertheless is faster than in control cells. thus, altogether, these results indicate that the knockdown of golph3 increased the endocytic recycling of egfr in t98g cells.",pmc7700535,1,100,40,1,140

high proliferation rate of tumor cells, diffused necrosis and neoangiogenesis [27]. a number of evidence indicated the presence of infiltrative tumor cells endowed with specific skills able to promote tumor progression in the apparently normal brain tissue surrounding gbm [28–30]. in addition, the interplay between tumor cells and ecs is a crucial event that results in the formation of new blood vessels, promoting tumor progression. the angiogenic dependency of gbm is strongly demonstrated by data from studies with angiogenesis inhibitors, mainly acting against vegf/vegfr [31, 32]. the administration of bevacizumab, an anti-vegf monoclonal antibody, to gbm patients has been demonstrated to be effective in prolonging both progression-free survival and overall survival. nevertheless, many patients rapidly develop resistance to anti-vegf treatments [32]. in a recent study, the dual inhibition of vegfr and angiopoietin-2 in two orthotopic models of gbm, improved mice survival by reducing cell growth, increasing cell necrosis and promoting morphological normalization of the vasculature [31]. in this study, we first focused on the expression of specific angiogenesis-related markers in gbm, in the peritumoral tissue as well as in gbm- and peritumoral tissue-derived cscs (defined in this work gcscs and pcscs, respectively) of five patients. with regard to tissue samples, since the high structural complexity of gbm and its peritumoral tissue makes cell counting sometimes ambiguous and of difficult interpretation, we turned to a relatively novel approach, namely stereology, in order to accurately estimate the total number of cells expressing each of the angiogenic markers investigated within a region of interest (roi). this approach allowed us to obtain quantitative and unbiased evidence of a three-dimensional structure, based on the analysis performed on two-dimensional histological sections. by taking advantage of this methodology, we were able to estimate the cell density (cells/mm2) of each specific marker by dividing the number of either immunopositive or immunonegative cells by the area of the roi. furthermore, we next assessed the ability of gcscs and pcscs to affect the behavior of ecs in vitro. we report here the expression of hif1α, hif2α, vegf, vegfr1 and vegfr2 in both gbm and peritumoral tissue, indicating that both areas contain, to some extent, cells that are either responsive to angiogenic stimuli or able to trigger angiogenic response. these findings are in accordance with and strengthen our previous observation of the presence of the type vi intermediate filament nestin and the proliferation-associated and hypoxia-inducible protein cd105 in the vasculature not only in the gbm but also in the tissue surrounding the tumor [11]. in addition, these data support the occurrence of neoangiogenesis in the peritumoral tissue even in the absence of cells with neoplastic morphology. although the density of cells positive for each marker resulted highly heterogeneous among patients, our results highlight an overall higher number of positive stained cells in gbm with respect to the peritumoral tissue. however, the high density of hif2α-positive cells found in both gbm and peritumoral tissue might be indicative of multiple functions of this molecule, such as the maintenance of the csc population or the induction of a csc phenotype in non-stem cancer cells [33] and may also indicate the presence of potential hypoxic regions in our tissue samples. indeed, unlike hif1α, hif2α has been markedly reported to be expressed only under elevated hypoxic condition in many organs [34]. moreover, kinetic of hif protein activation has been demonstrated to be different, with hif1α expression reported to be transient and shortly active, while hif2α activity appears more sustained [34]. however, some studies suggest that the two hif isoforms may play differential and non-overlapping roles in cancer due to their unique target genes as well as dissimilar responses to restricted oxygen levels. since the expression of hif1α or hif2α has been detected at higher level in tumor tissues compared to the tumor surrounding tissue, we can hypothesize that the high expression of hif2α in peritumoral tissue might be seen as a further sign of an initial transformation. regarding the expression of vegf and its receptors, in agreement with previous studies [35, 36] we found vegf considerably higher in the tumor, with almost 50% of the cells expressing this marker, with respect to the peritumoral tissue. by contrast, the cellular density of vegfr1 and vegfr2 was low in both regions. however, it has been also reported that the expression of vegf in different type of tumors does not necessarily correlate with the expression of its receptors [37]. moreover, it has been recently described a heterogeneous expression pattern of vegf as well as vegfr1 and 2 among astrocytomas of different grades and that beneficial response to bevacizumab treatment is independent of the expression of vegf and its co-receptors [38]. our in vitro studies on gcscs and pcscs indicate the hypoxia dependency of hif factors. in particular, the data concerning the expression pattern of hif1α confirmed the reliance of this transcription factor on oxygen depletion. the increased levels of this factor found in pcscs may suggest a possible role in the development of the resistance to chemo/radiotherapy occurring after the complete surgical removal of the gbm enhanced lesion. indeed, high hif1α levels were previously demonstrated to be responsible for the induction of mdr1 gene and resistance to chemotherapy in hif1α-transfected human hepatoma cells [39] as well as in human cervical cancer cells [40]. with regard to the expression of hif2α in gcsc and pcsc neurospheres, the higher protein levels found in the former cell population was also in agreement with the expression of other angiogenesis related molecules such as ng2 and vegfr1, which are targets of hif2α [10, 41, 42]. this finding supports the idea of a more defined stem nature for gcsc population and it is not surprising given the role of hif2α in maintaining hypoxic tumor cells in an undifferentiated and malignant state. the high expression of vegf observed in gbm tissue can also explain the increased migration aptitude of ecs cultured in the presence of gcscs rather than pcscs. however, we observed an unusual activation of perk1/2 signaling in ecs cultured with either gcscs or pcscs, suggesting that a unique combination of soluble factors, including vegf, are released by cscs. interestingly, in vitro tube formation assay indicated that both tumor and peritumoral tissue-derived cscs can activate angiogenesis and in some instances proliferation of ecs, even though to different extents. these results indicate that both gcscs and pcscs own the skill of activating the “angiogenic switch”, a critical control point for tumor growth, when tumor begins to overexpress pro-angiogenic factors. whether or not the tumor recruited newly-born vessels were more permeable in response to soluble factors, such as vegf, released by gcscs or pcscs, has not been investigated in this work. the precise nature and combination of factors released by gcscs and pcscs that can affect tumor blood vessel formation is still unclear, encouraging further efforts in the investigation of the mutual interaction between ecs and other cell types within gbm microenvironment. since the main issue with the anti-angiogenic therapies (e.g. bevacizumab) is the lack of biomarkers and angiogenic profiles which allow identifying patients who may benefit from this kind of treatment [43], it is important to better characterize the angiogenic signature of gbm and peritumoral tissue in order to identify other effective targets that may improve the management of gbm. in conclusion, taken together with our previous published data [7–11], the present findings strongly suggest the occurrence of early tumorigenic events in the gbm neighbouring tissue as well as the involvement of cscs residing in the peritumoral niche in the gbm radio- and chemo-resistance, which eventually results in tumor recurrence. this might prefigure a possible role of pcscs as therapeutic target.",pmc5346658,1,1,40,1,41
